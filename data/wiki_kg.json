        "page_content": "Case Sensitivity Handling\n\nCase Sensitivity Handling\n\nThe CountYourWords algorithm handles case sensitivity by treating words in a case-insensitive manner. This means that words like \"word\" and \"Word\" are counted as the same word, resulting in a total count of 1 for both occurrences.\n\nImplementation Details\n\nTo achieve this, the algorithm uses a HashMap<String, Integer> to store word counts. When processing each line of text, it splits the line into individual words using whitespace as the delimiter. Each word is then converted to lowercase before being added to the map. This ensures that all variations of the same word (e.g., \"apple\", \"Apple\", \"APPLE\") are counted together.\n\nHere is a simplified example of how this might be implemented in Java:\n\n```java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair\n\n    for (String line : fileLines) {\n        String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        for (String word : words) {\n            // Convert word to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity\n            String lowerCaseWord = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCounts.put(lowerCaseWord, wordCounts.getOrDefault(lowerCaseWord, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return new Pair<>(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTesting Case Sensitivity\n\nTo verify that the case-insensitivity handling works as expected, a test method named testCaseInsensitivity is provided in the CountYourWordsTest class. This test adds a line with multiple occurrences of \"apple\" (in different cases) to an ArrayList. It then calls the count() method and asserts that the total word count is 4 and that the word counts are case-insensitive.\n\n```java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList\n\n    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\n    assertEquals(4, result.getFirst());\n\n    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\n    expectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4);\n\n    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nTo better visualize the flow of data through the count() method, a simple Mermaid diagram can be used:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[Input: ArrayList<String> fileLines] --> B{Split line into words}; B -- Word is \"apple\" --> C{Convert to lowercase}; C -- Lowercase word is \"apple\" --> D[Update word count in HashMap]; D --> E[Repeat for all words and lines]; E --> F[Return Pair with total word count and word counts map];\n\nThis diagram shows the key steps involved in counting words, including splitting lines into words, converting them to lowercase, updating the word count map, and returning the results.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords algorithm handles case sensitivity by treating all variations of a word as the same. This is achieved through the use of a HashMap<String, Integer> where each word is converted to lowercase before being added or updated in the map. The provided test method ensures that this functionality works correctly, and a Mermaid diagram helps visualize the flow of data through the algorithm.",

        "page_content": "Data Storage Layer\n\nData Storage Layer\n\nThe CountYourWords system relies on a straightforward data storage layer to manage and store text files. This layer is crucial for reading, processing, and storing word counts efficiently.\n\nFile System Usage\n\nCountYourWords primarily uses the file system to store text files that need to be processed. The system reads these files from disk and processes their contents to count words and sort them.\n\nExample File Structure\n\nThe project includes several test files located in src/test/textTests/:\n\nemptyFile.txt: An empty file used for testing edge cases.\n\nexampleFile.txt: A sample text file containing multiple lines of text.\n\nnonPeriodFile.txt: A file without periods, which is handled by the system.\n\nvalidFile.txt: A valid text file with typical content.\n\nCode Example: Reading a File\n\nBelow is an example of how the CountYourWords class reads a file into an ArrayList<String>:\n\njava public static ArrayList<String> readFile(String filePath) { ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>(); try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { fileLines.add(line); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } return fileLines; }\n\nSource: CountYourWords.java, PK: 5eaef14f997e9bade8f52072d6f161e7\n\nThis method reads each line from the specified file and adds it to an ArrayList. It handles exceptions gracefully, ensuring that any I/O errors are logged.\n\nDatabase Usage\n\nCountYourWords does not use a traditional database for storing word counts. Instead, it uses in-memory data structures such as HashMap to store and manage word counts efficiently.\n\nExample Code: Counting Words\n\nThe following code snippet demonstrates how the CountYourWords class counts words in a list of strings:\n\njava public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String line : fileLines) { String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { word = word.toLowerCase(); if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } } return new Pair<>(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts); }\n\nSource: CountYourWords.java, PK: 5eaef14f997e9bade8f52072d6f161e7\n\nThis method splits each line into words, counts their occurrences, and stores them in a HashMap. The Pair class is used to return both the total number of unique words and the word count map.\n\nSummary\n\nThe CountYourWords system's data storage layer is designed to efficiently read text files from disk and process their contents using in-memory data structures. This approach ensures that the system can handle large datasets without significant performance degradation. The use of HashMap for storing word counts allows for quick lookups and updates, making it an ideal choice for this application.",

        "page_content": "Text Analysis\n\nText Analysis\n\nCountYourWords provides robust text analysis capabilities to help users understand and extract meaningful information from textual data. This section delves into the features related to analyzing text, such as frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.\n\nFrequency Analysis\n\nFrequency analysis is a fundamental technique used to determine how often each word appears in a given text. CountYourWords uses this feature to provide insights into the distribution of words within a document. The following code snippet demonstrates how frequency analysis can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class FrequencyAnalyzer { public static Map\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return wordCount;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\";\n    Map<String, Integer> frequencyMap = analyzeFrequency(text);\n    System.out.println(frequencyMap);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nSentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. CountYourWords utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis. The following code snippet illustrates how sentiment analysis can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class SentimentAnalyzer { private static final Map\n\nstatic {\n    sentimentScores.put(\"happy\", 1);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"sad\", -1);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"angry\", -2);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"excited\", 2);\n}\n\npublic static int analyzeSentiment(String text) {\n    String[] words = text.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\");\n    int sentimentScore = 0;\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (sentimentScores.containsKey(word)) {\n            sentimentScore += sentimentScores.get(word);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return sentimentScore;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"I am very happy today.

CountYourWords uses techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract keywords. The following code snippet demonstrates how keyword extraction can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class KeywordExtractor { public static Map\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    double totalWords = wordCount.size();\n    Map<String, Double> keywordScores = new HashMap<>();\n\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) {\n        String word = entry.getKey();\n        int count = entry.getValue();\n        double score = (count / totalWords) * Math.log(totalWords / 1.0); // Simplified TF-IDF\n        keywordScores.put(word, score);\n    }\n\n    return keywordScores;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\";\n    Map<String, Double> keywords = extractKeywords(text);\n    System.out.println(keywords);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTools and Libraries\n\nCountYourWords leverages several tools and libraries to enhance its text analysis capabilities:\n\nJava Collections Framework: Used for data structures like HashMap to store word counts.\n\nJUnit: For unit testing the text analysis features, ensuring they work as expected.\n\nHamcrest Core: Provides matchers for assertions in JUnit tests.\n\nThese tools and libraries help ensure that CountYourWords is both efficient and reliable in its text analysis tasks.",

        "page_content": "Testing Strategy\n\nTesting Strategy\n\nThe CountYourWords project employs a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure the reliability and correctness of its components. This strategy includes both unit tests and integration tests, leveraging JUnit 4.13.2 for assertions.\n\nUnit Tests\n\nUnit tests are designed to validate individual methods or functions within the application. The primary focus is on the CountYourWords class and its associated helper methods. Below are some key unit test cases:\n\nSorting Algorithm\n\nThe sorting algorithm in CountYourWords.sort() method is tested using JUnit. Here’s an example of a unit test for sorting an empty map:\n\njava @Test public void sortEmptyTest() { HashMap<String, Integer> emptyMap = new HashMap<>(); ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(emptyMap); assertTrue(\"Array should be empty\", sortedArray.isEmpty()); }\n\nThis test ensures that the sorting method returns an empty list when provided with an empty map.\n\nWord Counting\n\nThe CountYourWords.count() method is tested to ensure it correctly counts words in different scenarios. Here’s a unit test for counting words in a single line:\n\n```java @Test public void testSingleLine() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(\"Total words should be 2\", 2, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1);\n\nassertEquals(\"Word counts should match expected counts\", expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nThis test verifies that the word count is accurate and that the map of word counts contains the correct entries.\n\nIntegration Tests\n\nIntegration tests are used to verify the interaction between different components or modules. For CountYourWords, integration tests focus on testing the end-to-end functionality using real text files.\n\nTesting with Empty File\n\nThe CountYourWords.count() method is tested with an empty file:\n\n```java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\nassertEquals(\"Total words should be 0\", 0, result.getFirst());\nassertTrue(\"Word counts map should be empty\", result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n\n} ```\n\nThis test ensures that the method handles an empty file correctly.\n\nTesting with Multiple Lines\n\nThe CountYourWords.count() method is tested with multiple lines of text:\n\n```java @Test public void testMultipleLines() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(\"Total words should be 9\", 9, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\nassertEquals(\"Word counts should match expected counts\", expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nThis test ensures that the method correctly counts words across multiple lines.\n\nAdditional Notes\n\nDependencies: The testing strategy relies on JUnit for assertions and Hamcrest for more expressive matchers.\n\nTest Data: Test files are located in CountYourWords/src/test/textTests/, including emptyFile.txt, exampleFile.txt, nonPeriodFile.txt, and validFile.txt.\n\nThis comprehensive testing approach ensures that the CountYourWords project is robust and reliable, providing accurate word counts and sorted results.",

        "page_content": "Sorting Mechanisms\n\nSorting Mechanisms\n\nThe CountYourWords project utilizes a sorting mechanism to organize word count results before presentation. This ensures that the output is not only accurate but also easy to interpret, with words presented in ascending order based on their frequency.\n\nOverview of the Sorting Algorithm\n\nThe primary sorting algorithm used in CountYourWords is an insertion sort. This method is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency for smaller datasets, which is typical for word count results. The insertion sort algorithm works by iterating through the list, comparing each element with the ones before it, and inserting it into the correct position.\n\nImplementation Details\n\nThe sorting logic is encapsulated in the CountYourWords.sort method, located in the CountYourWords.java file. Below is a detailed breakdown of this method:\n\n```java public static ArrayList\n\n// Now to add the values back\nfor (String word : sortedWords) {\n    String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word));\n    String fString = word + \" \" + value;\n    sortedWordCounts.add(fString);\n}\n\nreturn sortedWordCounts;\n\n} ```\n\nKey Points: - Input: The method takes a HashMap<String, Integer> where keys are words and values are their counts. - Output: It returns an ArrayList<String> containing strings of sorted words with their counts. - Sorting Logic: Words are first extracted from the HashMap and sorted using the Sort.insertionSort method. Each word is then combined with its count to form a string, which is added to the result list.\n\nTesting the Sorting Mechanism\n\nTo ensure the sorting mechanism works as expected, comprehensive tests are provided in the CountYourWordsTest.java file. Below are some key test cases:\n\n```java @Test public void sortSingleTest() { HashMap\n\n@Test public void sortMultipleTest() { HashMap\n\nList<String> expectedKeys = Arrays.asList(\"apple 1\", \"banana 1\", \"cherry 1\");\nList<String> actualKeys = sortedArray;\n\nassertEquals(\"Keys should be sorted\", expectedKeys, actualKeys);\n\n} ```\n\nKey Points: - sortSingleTest: Tests sorting with a single word. - sortMultipleTest: Tests sorting with multiple words and verifies the order.\n\nComplexity Analysis\n\nThe insertion sort algorithm used in CountYourWords has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to its nested loops. This is suitable for smaller datasets, which is typical for word count results. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted words and their counts.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe sorting mechanism in CountYourWords is designed to organize word count results efficiently using an insertion sort algorithm. This ensures that the output is presented in ascending order based on word frequency, making it easy to interpret and analyze. The provided tests cover various scenarios to ensure the correctness of the sorting logic.",

        "page_content": "Frameworks and Libraries\n\nFrameworks and Libraries\n\nThe CountYourWords project relies on several frameworks and libraries to facilitate its development. These tools enhance various aspects of the application, from testing and assertions to sorting algorithms.\n\nHamcrest Core (hamcrest-core-1.3.jar)\n\nPurpose: Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects in Java. It provides a more readable way to assert conditions in tests compared to traditional JUnit assertions.\n\nRole: This library is used extensively for creating custom matchers in the test suite, making it easier to write expressive and maintainable test cases.\n\nJUnit (junit-4.13.2.jar)\n\nPurpose: JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java applications. It allows developers to write repeatable tests that validate their code.\n\nRole: The CountYourWords project uses JUnit to create unit tests for its core functionality, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under various conditions.\n\nCustom Libraries and Classes\n\nIn addition to external libraries, the CountYourWords project includes several custom classes and utilities:\n\nPair Class (src/main/Pair.java)\n\nPurpose: The Pair class is a simple utility class used to store two related objects together. It is particularly useful in sorting algorithms where pairs of words and their counts need to be maintained.\n\nRole: This class simplifies the handling of word-count pairs, making the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nSort Class (src/main/Sort.java)\n\nPurpose: The Sort class contains various sorting algorithms. Currently, it includes an insertion sort implementation, which is used to sort words alphabetically before counting their occurrences.\n\nRole: This class encapsulates the logic for sorting operations, ensuring that the main application logic remains clean and focused on word processing.\n\nExample Code Snippets\n\nBelow are some example code snippets demonstrating the use of these frameworks and libraries:\n\nHamcrest Matcher Example (src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java)\n\n```java import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { // Arrange String input = \"hello world hello\"; CountYourWords countYourWords = new CountYourWords();\n\n    // Act\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = countYourWords.countWords(input);\n\n    // Assert\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"hello\"), equalTo(2));\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"world\"), equalTo(1));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nJUnit Test Example (src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java)\n\n```java import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { // Arrange String input = \"hello world hello\"; CountYourWords countYourWords = new CountYourWords();\n\n    // Act\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = countYourWords.countWords(input);\n\n    // Assert\n    assertEquals(2, (int) wordCounts.get(\"hello\"));\n    assertEquals(1, (int) wordCounts.get(\"world\"));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSort Algorithm Example (src/main/Sort.java)\n\n```java import java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    ArrayList<String> sortedList = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (String s : array) {\n        sortedList.add(s);\n    }\n    return sortedList;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships between the main components of the CountYourWords project:\n\nmermaid graph TD A[CountYourWords.java] --> B[Sort.java] A --> C[Pair.java] B --> D[junit-4.13.2.jar] C --> E[hamcrest-core-1.3.jar]\n\nThis diagram shows how the main application class depends on sorting and utility classes, which in turn depend on testing and assertion libraries.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project leverages several frameworks and libraries to enhance its development process. Hamcrest and JUnit provide robust testing capabilities, while custom classes like Pair and Sort encapsulate specific functionality. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for anyone working on or maintaining the CountYourWords project.",

        "page_content": "User Interface Features\n\nUser Interface Features\n\nCountYourWords provides a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to interact with the text parsing functionality. The primary components of the user interface include:\n\nConsole Input/Output\n\nThe application reads input from a fixed file named input.txt located in the project directory. The output is displayed directly in the console, showing the total number of words and their occurrences.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Main class to read input and display results public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) { HashMap\n\nprivate static void processLine(String line, HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\");\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            word = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nFile Handling\n\nThe application handles file reading and writing operations. It reads from input.txt and writes the results to the console.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Utility class for file handling public class FileUtils { public static String readFile(String filePath) throws IOException { StringBuilder content = new StringBuilder(); try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { content.append(line).append(\"\\n\"); } } return content.toString(); }\n\npublic static void writeFile(String filePath, String content) throws IOException {\n    try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath))) {\n        writer.write(content);\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSorting Algorithm\n\nThe application includes a custom sorting algorithm to sort the words alphabetically. This algorithm is implemented in the Sort class.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Custom sorting algorithm public class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    // Now to add the values back\n    for (String word : sortedWords) {\n        String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word));\n        String fString = word + \" \" + value;\n        sortedWordCounts.add(fString);\n    }\n\n    return sortedWordCounts;\n}\n\nprivate static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) {\n    ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array));\n    for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) {\n        String key = list.get(i);\n        int j = i - 1;\n        while (j >= 0 && list.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) {\n            list.set(j + 1, list.get(j));\n            j--;\n        }\n        list.set(j + 1, key);\n    }\n    return list;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nError Handling\n\nThe application includes basic error handling to manage file reading and processing errors.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Main class with error handling public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) { HashMap\n\nprivate static void processLine(String line, HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\");\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            word = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSummary\n\nThe user interface of CountYourWords is designed to be simple and straightforward. It reads input from a fixed file, processes the text using custom logic, sorts the results alphabetically, and outputs them directly to the console. The application includes basic error handling to manage file reading errors.\n\nThis section provides an overview of the key components and their interactions within the CountYourWords user interface.",

This process involves several key steps, including sorting and filtering the word counts before final presentation.\n\nSorting Word Counts\n\nWord counts are sorted based on their frequency in descending order. The sorting logic is implemented in the Sort.java file. Below is a code snippet demonstrating the sorting method:\n\n```java public class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    // Sort the list based on value (frequency)\n    Collections.sort(list, new Comparator<Map.Entry<String, Integer>>() {\n        public int compare(Map.Entry<String, Integer> o1, Map.Entry<String, Integer> o2) {\n            return (o2.getValue()).compareTo(o1.getValue());\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Convert sorted list back to ArrayList of strings\n    ArrayList<String> sortedList = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) {\n        sortedList.add(entry.getKey() + \" \" + entry.getValue());\n    }\n\n    return sortedList;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: 1. Conversion to List: The HashMap of word counts is converted into a List of entries. 2. Sorting: The list is sorted using Collections.sort() with a custom comparator that compares the values (frequencies) in descending order. 3. Conversion Back to ArrayList: The sorted list is then converted back into an ArrayList<String> where each element represents a word and its count.\n\nFiltering Word Counts\n\nFiltering is not explicitly implemented in the current version of CountYourWords, but it could be added if needed. For example, one might want to filter out words that appear less than a certain number of times or exclude common stop words.\n\nPresentation of Results\n\nThe final step in output generation is presenting the sorted word counts to the user. This is handled by the main method in the App.java file:\n\n```java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\n    System.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \");\n\n    // Reading File name\n    String path = \"\";\n    try {\n        path = br.readLine();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n\n    ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);\n    Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n    ArrayList<String> finaList = Sort.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond());\n    System.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst());\n    for (String line : finaList) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: 1. User Input: The user is prompted to enter the file path. 2. File Reading and Counting: The readFile method reads the file, and the count method counts the words. 3. Sorting: The word counts are sorted using the Sort.sort() method. 4. Output: The total number of words and the sorted list are printed to the console.\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data through the output generation process:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[User Input] --> B[Read File]; B --> C[Count Words]; C --> D[Sort Word Counts]; D --> E[Output Results];\n\nExplanation: 1. User Input: The user provides a file path. 2. Read File: The file is read and its contents are stored in an ArrayList. 3. Count Words: The word counts are calculated using the count method. 4. Sort Word Counts: The word counts are sorted based on frequency. 5. Output Results: The total number of words and the sorted list are displayed to the user.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the word count results are presented in a clear, organized manner, making it easy for users to understand the distribution of words in their text files.",

        "page_content": "Word Counting Algorithm\n\nWord Counting Algorithm\n\nThe CountYourWords project includes a robust word counting algorithm that processes input text to count occurrences of each word. This algorithm is crucial for various applications such as text analysis, SEO optimization, and natural language processing.\n\nTokenization\n\nTokenization is the process of breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords algorithm uses a simple yet effective tokenization method:\n\njava public static ArrayList<String> tokenize(String text) { return new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\s+\"))); }\n\nThis method splits the input text using whitespace as the delimiter and returns an ArrayList of tokens.\n\nCase Sensitivity Handling\n\nThe algorithm handles case sensitivity by converting all words to lowercase before counting. This ensures that words like \"Hello\" and \"hello\" are counted as the same word:\n\njava public static HashMap<String, Integer> countWords(ArrayList<String> tokens) { HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String token : tokens) { String lowerCaseToken = token.toLowerCase(); wordCounts.put(lowerCaseToken, wordCounts.getOrDefault(lowerCaseToken, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; }\n\nPunctuation Rules\n\nThe algorithm ignores punctuation when counting words. For example, \"hello,\" and \"hello\" are considered the same word:\n\njava public static ArrayList<String> cleanTokens(ArrayList<String> tokens) { ArrayList<String> cleanedTokens = new ArrayList<>(); for (String token : tokens) { if (!token.matches(\"[^a-zA-Z0-9]+\")) { cleanedTokens.add(token.toLowerCase()); } } return cleanedTokens; }\n\nThis method filters out any tokens that contain non-alphanumeric characters, ensuring that only words are counted.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nThe CountYourWords algorithm combines these steps to count the occurrences of each word in a given text:\n\njava public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { ArrayList<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>(); for (String line : fileLines) { tokens.addAll(cleanTokens(tokenize(line))); } int totalWords = tokens.size(); HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = countWords(tokens); return new Pair<>(totalWords, wordCounts); }\n\nThis method processes each line of the input text, cleans and tokenizes it, counts the words, and returns a Pair containing the total number of words and a map of word frequencies.\n\nExample Usage\n\nTo use the CountYourWords algorithm, you can call the count method with an ArrayList of file lines:\n\n```java public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList\n\nPair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Total words: \" + result.getFirst());\nSystem.out.println(\"Word counts: \" + result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to count the occurrences of each word in a list of file lines and print the results.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project's word counting algorithm is designed to be efficient, accurate, and easy to understand. By handling tokenization, case sensitivity, and punctuation rules, this algorithm provides valuable insights into text data, making it an essential component for various applications in natural language processing and text analysis.",

        "page_content": "Filtering Criteria\n\nFiltering Criteria\n\nThe CountYourWords project includes several filtering rules applied to the word count data before it is presented to the user. These filters ensure that the output is accurate and meaningful, adhering to specific requirements and constraints.\n\nCase Insensitivity\n\nOne of the primary filtering criteria is case insensitivity. The system ensures that words are counted without considering their case (e.g., \"apple\" and \"Apple\" are considered the same word). This is crucial for providing a more comprehensive word count analysis.\n\nExample Usage: ```java @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(4, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: In the example above, the testCaseInsensitivity method tests the case insensitivity of word counting. It adds a line with multiple occurrences of \"apple\" (in different cases) to an ArrayList. The CountYourWords.count() method is then called with this list, and it returns a Pair containing the total word count and the word counts map.\n\nThe test asserts that the total word count is 4 and that the word counts are case-insensitive. This ensures that all occurrences of \"apple\" are counted as one.\n\nEmpty File Handling\n\nAnother important filtering rule is handling empty files. If a file is empty, the system should return a total word count of 0 and an empty map for word counts.\n\nExample Usage: ```java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\nassertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: The testEmptyFile method tests the handling of empty files. It creates an empty ArrayList and calls the CountYourWords.count() method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 0 and that the word counts map is empty.\n\nThis ensures that the system correctly handles cases where no words are present in the file, providing a consistent and meaningful output.\n\nSingle Line Handling\n\nThe system also includes filtering rules for handling files with a single line. It should accurately count the words in the single line and return the correct word counts.\n\nExample Usage: ```java @Test public void testSingleLine() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(2, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: The testSingleLine method tests the handling of files with a single line. It creates an ArrayList containing a single line and calls the CountYourWords.count() method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 2 and that the word counts match the expected values.\n\nThis ensures that the system correctly handles cases where words are present in a single line, providing accurate and meaningful output.\n\nMultiple Lines Handling\n\nFinally, the system includes filtering rules for handling files with multiple lines. It should accurately count the words across all lines and return the correct word counts.\n\nExample Usage: ```java @Test public void testMultipleLines() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(9, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: The testMultipleLines method tests the handling of files with multiple lines. It creates an ArrayList containing multiple lines and calls the CountYourWords.count() method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 9 and that the word counts match the expected values.\n\nThis ensures that the system correctly handles cases where words are present across multiple lines, providing accurate and meaningful output.\n\nSummary\n\nThe filtering criteria in the CountYourWords project ensure that the word count data is processed accurately and meaningfully. The case insensitivity rule ensures that words are counted without considering their case, while the handling of empty files, single lines, and multiple lines ensures that the system correctly processes different types of input.\n\nThese filters contribute to a more comprehensive and reliable word count analysis, providing valuable insights into the content of text files.",

        "page_content": "Input Handling\n\nInput Handling\n\nOverview\n\nUser input is a crucial aspect of any application, especially one like CountYourWords that processes text files. The input handling process in CountYourWords involves receiving user input, validating it, and storing it in appropriate data structures before further processing.\n\nReceiving User Input\n\nThe primary method for receiving user input in CountYourWords is through the main method in the App.java file:\n\n```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \");\n\n// Reading File name\nString path = \"\";\ntry {\n    path = br.readLine();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);\nPair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\nArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond());\nSystem.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst());\nfor (String line : finaList) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nThis method prompts the user to enter a file path and reads it from standard input. The readFile method in the CountYourWords.java class is then called with this path to read the contents of the file.\n\nValidating User Input\n\nInput validation is essential to ensure that the application handles invalid or unexpected inputs gracefully. In CountYourWords, the primary validation step occurs when reading the user input:\n\njava String path = \"\"; try { path = br.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); }\n\nIf an IOException is thrown during this process, it indicates that there was a problem with reading from standard input. In a production environment, you would want to handle this exception more gracefully, possibly by prompting the user again or providing an error message.\n\nStoring Input Data\n\nThe input data, which in this case is the contents of a text file, is stored in an ArrayList<String>:\n\njava ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);\n\nThis list holds each line of the file as a separate element. The readFile method reads the file and populates this list.\n\nData Structures\n\nThe primary data structure used for storing input data in CountYourWords is an ArrayList<String>. This allows for efficient addition, removal, and access of elements by index. Additionally, the application uses other data structures such as HashMap<String, Integer> to count word occurrences and Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> to store both the total word count and the word counts.\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nHere is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data through the input handling process:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[User Input] --> B{Validation}; B -- Valid --> C[Read File]; C --> D[Store in ArrayList<String>]; D --> E[Count Words]; E --> F[Sort Words]; F --> G[Display Results];\n\nConclusion\n\nThe input handling process in CountYourWords is a critical part of the application's architecture. It involves receiving user input, validating it, and storing it in appropriate data structures before further processing. By understanding this process, developers can better appreciate how user inputs are managed within the application and ensure that the system handles various scenarios gracefully.",

        "page_content": "Introduction to CountYourWords\n\nIntroduction\n\nCountYourWords is a Java project designed as a text parser that processes an input file (input.txt) to count words and their occurrences. The project adheres to specific constraints, including ignoring numbers, special characters, and case sensitivity. The goal of the project is to produce production-ready code with comprehensive testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Additionally, the application must be designed following SOLID principles and object-oriented programming practices.\n\nProject Structure\n\nThe CountYourWords project has a structured file tree as follows:\n\nCountYourWords/ ├── lib/ │ ├── hamcrest-core-1.3.jar │ └── junit-4.13.2.jar ├── readme.md ├── src/ │ ├── main/ │ │ ├── App.java │ │ ├── CountYourWords.java │ │ ├── Pair.java │ │ └── Sort.java │ └── test/ │ ├── CountYourWordsTest.java │ ├── SortTest.java │ └── textTests/ │ ├── emptyFile.txt │ ├── exampleFile.txt │ ├── nonPeriodFile.txt │ └── validFile.txt\n\nKey Components\n\n1. readme.md\n\nThis file provides a detailed overview of the project, including its description, constraints, and goals. It serves as the primary documentation for developers.\n\nExample Content: ```markdown\n\nProject Description\n\nI am creating a text parser in Java named CountYourWords.\n\nConstraints\n\nNumbers in the document are ignored and are not processed\n\nOther characters than words should be filtered out of the input, so ## or @ or !! are ignored\n\nYou do not have to take in account strange combinations like: love4u or mail@address.nl, combinations like these are out of scope for this assignment\n\nNext to showing the total number of words in the document, the number of occurrences of each word is also calculated\n\nThe total number of occurrences next to the word must be shown on screen one by one (in lowercase)\n\nCounting the occurrences per word is case insensitive (so Matchbox, matchbox, and MATCHBOX are all the same word)\n\nWhen printing the occurrences, the words must be in alphabetical order\n\nYou cannot use a built-in .NET sort routine, so produce on of your own, it does not have to be the fastest sort-routine as long as it is reliable end reusable.\n\nThe document is a text file that will be read by your console app and has the fixed name: input.txt\n\nGoal\n\nThe code must be production code, use everything you would use in production. You are allowed to use third party components if required (except for the sorting)\n\nAll classes can be in one .NET core console application (assembly), as long as you show clear separation\n\nEverything must be done using testing and TDD\n\nUse SOLID and object-oriented programming ```\n\n2. CountYourWords.java\n\nThis is the main class of the project, responsible for orchestrating the word counting process.\n\nExample Code: ```java import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.HashMap;\n\npublic class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { String fileName = \"input.txt\"; HashMap\n\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\");\n            for (String word : words) {\n                if (!word.isEmpty() && !Character.isDigit(word.charAt(0))) {\n                    wordCounts.put(word.toLowerCase(), wordCounts.getOrDefault(word.toLowerCase(), 0) + 1);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        ArrayList<String> sortedWordCounts = Sort.sort(wordCounts);\n        for (String entry : sortedWordCounts) {\n            System.out.println(entry);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\n3. Sort.java\n\nThis class contains a method to sort the word counts alphabetically.\n\nExample Code: ```java import java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\npublic static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    ArrayList<String> sortedWordCounts = new ArrayList<>();\n    // Sort the words first\n    ArrayList<String> sortedWords = insertionSort(wordCounts.keySet().toArray(new String[0]));\n\n    // Now to add the values back\n    for (String word : sortedWords) {\n        String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word));\n        String fString = word + \" \" + value;\n        sortedWordCounts.add(fString);\n    }\n\n    return sortedWordCounts;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships and dependencies within the CountYourWords project:\n\nmermaid graph TD A[CountYourWords.java] --> B(App.java) A --> C(CountYourWords.java) A --> D(Sort.java) B --> E(CountYourWords.java) C --> F(Sort.java) D --> G(Sort.java)\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project is a comprehensive text parser that processes an input file to count words and their occurrences. It adheres to specific constraints, uses TDD for development, and follows SOLID principles. The project structure includes essential files such as readme.md, CountYourWords.java, and Sort.java.

Below, we will detail each component in depth.\n\nInput Processing\n\nInput processing involves reading the contents of input.txt and preparing it for further processing. This step ensures that only valid words are considered, ignoring numbers and special characters.\n\nCode Snippet: ```java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { String input = readFile(\"input.txt\"); List\n\nprivate static String readFile(String fileName) throws IOException {\n    return new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(fileName)));\n}\n\nprivate static List<String> preprocess(String input) {\n    return Arrays.asList(input.replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\").toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\s+\"));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: - readFile: Reads the contents of input.txt and returns it as a string. - preprocess: Removes non-alphabetic characters, converts the text to lowercase, and splits it into individual words.\n\nWord Counting\n\nWord counting involves counting the occurrences of each word in the preprocessed list. This step uses a HashMap to store word counts efficiently.\n\nCode Snippet: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java private static Map<String, Integer> countWords(List<String> words) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String word : words) { wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; }\n\nExplanation: - countWords: Iterates through the list of words and updates a HashMap with the count of each word.\n\nOutput Generation\n\nOutput generation involves sorting the word counts alphabetically and formatting them for display. This step uses a custom sort algorithm to ensure reliability and reusability.\n\nCode Snippet: java // src/main/Sort.java public class Sort { public static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] words) { ArrayList<String> sortedWords = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(words)); for (int i = 1; i < sortedWords.size(); i++) { String key = sortedWords.get(i); int j = i - 1; while (j >= 0 && sortedWords.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) { sortedWords.set(j + 1, sortedWords.get(j)); j--; } sortedWords.set(j + 1, key); } return sortedWords; } }\n\nExplanation: - insertionSort: Implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort an array of words alphabetically.\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data through the core components:\n\nmermaid graph TD A[Input Processing] --> B[Word Counting] B --> C[Output Generation]\n\nExplanation: - Input Processing: Reads and preprocesses input.txt. - Word Counting: Counts occurrences of each word. - Output Generation: Sorts the word counts alphabetically and formats them for display.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords application is designed with a clear separation of concerns, making it modular and easy to maintain. Each component has a specific responsibility, ensuring that the system is scalable and extensible.",

This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The following sections detail the setup and tools used in each type of test.\n\nUnit Tests\n\nUnit tests focus on individual methods or functions within the codebase. For CountYourWords, these tests are located in the CountYourWordsTest.java file. The primary testing framework used is JUnit 4.13.2, which provides a robust set of annotations and utilities for writing and running tests.\n\nExample Unit Test\n\nHere is an example unit test from CountYourWordsTest.java:\n\njava @Test public void sortEmptyTest() { HashMap<String, Integer> emptyMap = new HashMap<>(); ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(emptyMap); assertTrue(\"Array should be empty\", sortedArray.isEmpty()); }\n\nThis test checks that the sort method correctly handles an empty map of word counts.\n\nIntegration Tests\n\nIntegration tests verify that different components of the application work together as expected. For CountYourWords, these tests are also located in the CountYourWordsTest.java file. The focus is on testing the interaction between methods and classes.\n\nExample Integration Test\n\nHere is an example integration test from CountYourWordsTest.java:\n\n```java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\nassertEquals(\"Total words should be 0\", 0, result.getFirst());\nassertTrue(\"Word counts map should be empty\", result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n\n} ```\n\nThis test checks that the count method correctly processes an empty file.\n\nEnd-to-End Tests\n\nEnd-to-end tests simulate real-world usage of the application. For CountYourWords, these tests are located in the textTests directory and involve reading files and counting words.\n\nExample End-to-End Test\n\nThe textTests directory contains several test files (emptyFile.txt, exampleFile.txt, etc.) that are used to simulate different scenarios. Here is an example of how one might write a simple script to run these tests:\n\nbash java -cp .:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar CountYourWordsTest\n\nThis command runs the CountYourWordsTest class using JUnit, which will execute all the tests defined within it.\n\nTesting Environment Setup\n\nThe testing environment is set up to use the following tools and libraries:\n\nJUnit 4.13.2: The primary testing framework.\n\nHamcrest Core 1.3: A library for writing matcher objects in Java.\n\nTest Files: Located in the textTests directory, these files are used to simulate different input scenarios.\n\nDiagrams\n\nBelow is a Mermaid diagram that illustrates the relationships between the test classes and methods:\n\nmermaid graph TD; CountYourWordsTest -->|sortEmptyTest| sortMethod CountYourWordsTest -->|sortSingleTest| sortMethod CountYourWordsTest -->|sortMultipleTest| sortMethod CountYourWordsTest -->|testEmptyFile| countMethod CountYourWordsTest -->|testSingleLine| countMethod CountYourWordsTest -->|testMultipleLines| countMethod\n\nThis diagram shows how the CountYourWordsTest class interacts with the sort and count methods.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe testing environment for CountYourWords is comprehensive, covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. By using JUnit 4.13.2 and Hamcrest Core 1.3, developers can ensure that all components of the application are thoroughly tested. The use of test files in the textTests directory allows for realistic simulation of user input scenarios.",

These integration points are crucial for understanding how various parts of the system interact with each other and with external resources.\n\nInternal Component Integration\n\nThe primary internal component in CountYourWords is the CountYourWords class, which handles the main logic for counting words in a text file. This class interacts with several other components:\n\nPair Class: The Pair class is used to store and return results from word count operations. It encapsulates two values: a total count of words and a HashMap mapping each word to its frequency.\n\n```java public final class Pair { private final int totalCount; private final HashMap\n\n   public Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) {\n       this.totalCount = first;\n       this.wordCounts = second;\n   }\n\n   public int getFirst() {\n       return totalCount;\n   }\n\n   public HashMap<String, Integer> getSecond() {\n       return wordCounts;\n   }\n\n} ```\n\nSort Class: The Sort class is responsible for sorting the results based on word frequency. It takes a Pair object as input and returns a sorted list of words.\n\njava public class Sort { public List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> sort(Pair pair) { List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entries = new ArrayList<>(pair.getSecond().entrySet()); Collections.sort(entries, (e1, e2) -> e2.getValue().compareTo(e1.getValue())); return entries; } }\n\nExternal System Integration\n\nCountYourWords interacts with external systems primarily through file operations. The project includes several test files located in the src/test/textTests directory:\n\nemptyFile.txt: An empty file used to test edge cases.\n\nexampleFile.txt: A sample text file containing words for word count.\n\nnonPeriodFile.txt: A file without periods, which might affect word separation logic.\n\nvalidFile.txt: A valid text file with proper formatting.\n\nThese files are read by the CountYourWords class to perform word counting operations. The project also includes test cases in the src/test/java/CountYourWordsTest.java and src/test/java/SortTest.java files, which utilize these external resources to validate the functionality of the system.\n\nIntegration Diagram\n\nTo better visualize the integration points within CountYourWords, a Mermaid diagram can be used:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[CountYourWords] --> B[Pair] A --> C[Sort] B --> D[Sort] C --> E[Test Cases] D --> F[Test Cases]\n\nThis diagram shows the flow of data and control within the CountYourWords system, highlighting how CountYourWords interacts with the Pair and Sort classes, as well as external test cases.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the integration points in CountYourWords are primarily internal component interactions (e.g., between CountYourWords, Pair, and Sort) and external system interactions (e.g., file operations for word counting). Understanding these integration points is essential for comprehending how different parts of the system work together to achieve its overall functionality.",

The output is displayed in a user-friendly format, showing both the total number of words and a sorted list of words along with their frequencies.\n\nUser Interface\n\nThe primary interface for presenting the output is the console. When the user runs the application and provides a valid file path, the program reads the file, counts the words, sorts them by frequency, and then prints the results to the console.\n\nHere is an example of how the output might look:\n\nplaintext Enter the Path : /path/to/file.txt Number of words: 20 big: 2 brown: 2 fox: 2 number: 1 4: 1 jumped: 2 over: 2 the: 2 lazy: 2 dog.: 1\n\nCode Explanation\n\nThe output generation is handled by the main method in the App.java class. Below is a detailed breakdown of how the output is generated:\n\n```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \");\n\n// Reading File name\nString path = \"\";\ntry {\n    path = br.readLine();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);\nPair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\nArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond());\nSystem.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst());\nfor (String line : finaList) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nReading the File Path: The program prompts the user to enter a file path and reads it from the standard input.\n\nFile Reading: The readFile method in the CountYourWords.java class is called to read the contents of the specified file into an ArrayList<String>.\n\nWord Counting: The count method processes the list of lines, counts the occurrences of each word, and returns a Pair object containing the total number of words and a map of word frequencies.\n\nSorting: The sort method sorts the words by frequency in descending order.\n\nOutput: The results are printed to the console. The total number of words is displayed first, followed by a sorted list of words with their respective counts.\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data and control within the main method:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[User enters file path] --> B{Read file?}; B -- Yes --> C[ReadFile(path)]; C --> D[Count(fileLines)]; D --> E[Sort(wordFrequencies)]; E --> F[Print(\"Number of words: %d\", totalCount)]; F --> G[Print(sortedWordList)]; B -- No --> H[Error handling];\n\nThis diagram shows the sequence of operations from user input to the final output, highlighting the key steps in the process.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords application presents word count results through a straightforward console interface. The output is generated by reading the file, counting words, sorting them, and then printing the results. This simple yet effective approach ensures that users can easily understand and utilize the tool for their word frequency analysis needs.",

        "page_content": "Word Counting\n\nWord Counting\n\nThe CountYourWords system is designed to count words in a given text input. This process involves several key steps, including tokenization, normalization, and counting. Below, we will delve into the details of how these steps are implemented within the system.\n\nTokenization\n\nTokenization is the first step in word counting. It involves breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords system uses a simple regular expression to identify words:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> tokenize(String text) { return Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\W+\")); }\n\nThis method splits the input text using any non-word character (\\\\W+) as the delimiter. The resulting list of tokens is then returned.\n\nNormalization\n\nNormalization involves converting all words to a consistent case (typically lowercase) to ensure that word counts are case-insensitive. This step helps in accurately counting occurrences of the same word regardless of its case:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> normalize(List<String> tokens) { return tokens.stream() .map(String::toLowerCase) .collect(Collectors.toList()); }\n\nThe normalize method takes a list of tokens and converts each token to lowercase using the String.toLowerCase() method. The resulting normalized list is then returned.\n\nCounting\n\nThe counting step involves iterating over the normalized list of words and keeping track of their occurrences. This can be efficiently done using a HashMap:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static Map<String, Integer> count(List<String> tokens) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String token : tokens) { wordCounts.put(token, wordCounts.getOrDefault(token, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; }\n\nThe count method takes a list of normalized tokens and iterates over each token. For each token, it updates the count in the wordCounts map using the getOrDefault method to handle cases where the token is not yet present in the map.\n\nEdge Cases\n\nHandling edge cases is crucial for robust word counting. Some common edge cases include:\n\nEmpty Input: If the input text is empty, the system should return a count of 0.\n\nPunctuation: Punctuation marks should be ignored when counting words. For example, \"hello,\" and \"hello\" should both be counted as \"hello\".\n\nCase Insensitivity: The word counting should be case-insensitive, so \"Hello\" and \"hello\" should be treated as the same word.\n\nThe provided test cases in CountYourWordsTest.java cover these edge cases:\n\n```java // src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\nassertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\nassertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n\n@Test public void testPunctuation() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(5, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"welcome\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"to\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n@Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(4, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nThese test cases ensure that the word counting system handles various edge cases correctly.\n\nPerformance Considerations\n\nFor large text inputs, performance can be a concern. The current implementation uses a simple HashMap for counting, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups. However, for very large inputs, this could become a bottleneck.\n\nTo improve performance, the system could use more advanced data structures or parallel processing techniques. For example, using a concurrent hash map (ConcurrentHashMap) or distributing the counting task across multiple threads could help handle larger inputs more efficiently.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords system provides a robust solution for counting words in text input. By breaking down the process into tokenization, normalization, and counting, the system ensures accurate word counts while handling various edge cases. The provided test cases validate the correctness of the implementation, and further performance optimizations can be considered for larger inputs.\n\nFor more detailed information on the CountYourWords project, refer to the project's README file.",

This helps in understanding which words are most common in the text.\n\nExample Code:\n\n```java // src/main/Sort.java public class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    ArrayList<String> sortedArray = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) {\n        sortedArray.add(entry.getKey() + \" \" + entry.getValue());\n    }\n    return sortedArray;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nUser Interface Features\n\nWhile the primary focus is on backend functionality, CountYourWords also includes a simple user interface to interact with the application. This feature allows users to input file paths and view word counts and their occurrences.\n\nExample Code:\n\n```java // src/main/App.java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length == 0) { System.out.println(\"Please provide a file path as an argument.\"); return; }\n\n    String filePath = args[0];\n    try {\n        ArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(filePath);\n        Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n        ArrayList<String> sortedArray = Sort.sort(result.getSecond());\n\n        System.out.println(\"Total words: \" + result.getFirst());\n        for (String entry : sortedArray) {\n            System.out.println(entry);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        System.err.println(\"Error reading file: \" + e.getMessage());\n    }\n}\n\nprivate static ArrayList<String> readFile(String filePath) throws IOException {\n    ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            lines.add(line);\n        }\n    }\n    return lines;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTesting\n\nCountYourWords is thoroughly tested to ensure its reliability and correctness. The testing framework includes unit tests for both the word counting and sorting functionalities.\n\nExample Test Code:\n\n```java // src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\n    assertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\n    assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testSingleLine() {\n    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();\n    fileLines.add(\"Hello world\");\n\n    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\n    assertEquals(2, result.getFirst());\n\n    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\n    expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1);\n\n    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testMultipleLines() {\n    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();\n    fileLines.add(\"Hello world\");\n    fileLines.add(\"This is a test.\");\n    fileLines.add(\"World of Java!\");\n\n    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\n    assertEquals(9, result.getFirst());\n\n    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\n    expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\n    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships between the key components of CountYourWords:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[App.java] --> B[CountYourWords.java]; A --> C[Sort.java]; B --> D[readFile(String filePath)]; B --> E[count(ArrayList<String> fileLines)]; E --> F[sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts)];\n\nThis diagram shows how the App class interacts with the CountYourWords and Sort classes to process a text file and display the results.",

This project aims to adhere to several key constraints and objectives:\n\nInput Processing:\n\nThe application reads from input.txt, which contains text data.\n\nNumbers, special characters, and case sensitivity are ignored during processing.\n\nOutput Requirements:\n\nThe total number of words in the document is displayed.\n\nEach word's occurrence count is shown on the screen, sorted alphabetically.\n\nWord counts are case insensitive (e.g., \"Matchbox\", \"matchbox\", and \"MATCHBOX\" are treated as the same word).\n\nCode Quality:\n\nThe code must be production-ready, using best practices in object-oriented programming and design patterns such as SOLID principles.\n\nTesting and TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodologies are strictly enforced to ensure code quality and reliability.\n\nImplementation Details:\n\nAll classes can be contained within a single .NET Core console application.\n\nA custom sorting algorithm must be implemented, as built-in sort routines are not allowed.\n\nDependencies:\n\nThird-party components may be used except for the sorting functionality, which must be implemented in-house.\n\nExample Usage\n\nThe application processes input.txt and outputs results based on the specified rules. For example, if input.txt contains:\n\nHello world This is a test. World of Java!\n\nThe output might be:\n\nTotal words: 9 hello 1 is 1 java 1 of 1 test 1 this 1 world 2\n\nCode Snippets\n\nBelow are snippets from the CountYourWords project that demonstrate key components of the implementation.\n\nCountYourWords.java\n\nThis class contains the main logic for processing the input and counting words.\n\n```java import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class CountYourWords { public static Pair count(ArrayList\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(\"input.txt\");\n    Pair result = count(fileLines);\n    System.out.println(\"Total words: \" + result.getFirst());\n    for (String entry : sort(result.getSecond())) {\n        System.out.println(entry);\n    }\n}\n\nprivate static ArrayList<String> readFile(String fileName) {\n    ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            lines.add(line);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    return lines;\n}\n\nprivate static ArrayList<String> sort(Map<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    // Custom sorting logic here\n    return new ArrayList<>();\n}\n\n} ```\n\nPair.java\n\nThis class represents a pair of values, typically used to return multiple results from methods.\n\n```java public class Pair { private int first; private Map\n\npublic Pair(int first, Map<String, Integer> second) {\n    this.first = first;\n    this.second = second;\n}\n\npublic int getFirst() {\n    return first;\n}\n\npublic Map<String, Integer> getSecond() {\n    return second;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSort.java\n\nThis class contains the custom sorting logic for word counts.\n\n```java import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Collections; import java.util.Comparator;\n\npublic class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the class relationships and dependencies within the CountYourWords project.\n\nmermaid graph TD A[CountYourWords] --> B[Pair] A --> C[Sort] B --> D{Read File} C --> E{Custom Sort}\n\nConclusion\n\nThe primary goal of CountYourWords is to create a text parser that processes input from input.txt, counts words, and outputs the results in a specified format.

This section outlines the key security measures in place, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption.\n\nAuthentication\n\nAuthentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting them access to the system. In CountYourWords, authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user logs in, they provide their credentials, which are verified against the stored credentials. If the credentials are valid, a JWT is issued and returned to the client.\n\njava // Example of JWT generation in Java String token = Jwts.builder() .setSubject(user.getUsername()) .setIssuedAt(new Date()) .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000)) // 1 day validity .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, \"secretKey\") .compact();\n\nThe JWT is then used in subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The server verifies the token's signature and expiration before granting access.\n\nAuthorization\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining what actions a user can perform within the system. In CountYourWords, authorization is enforced using Spring Security. Each endpoint has associated roles that determine which users are allowed to access it.\n\n```java // Example of securing an endpoint in Spring Security @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/api\") public class WordController {\n\n@GetMapping(\"/words\")\n@PreAuthorize(\"hasRole('USER')\")\npublic List<String> getWords() {\n    // Endpoint logic here\n}\n\n} ```\n\nIn this example, the /api/words endpoint is accessible only to users with the USER role.\n\nData Encryption\n\nData encryption is used to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit. In CountYourWords, data is encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) when stored in the database. Additionally, all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.\n\njava // Example of encrypting data using AES in Java public byte[] encrypt(byte[] data, SecretKey secretKey) throws Exception { Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\"); cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey); return cipher.doFinal(data); }\n\nThe encryption key is securely stored and managed to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt the data.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, CountYourWords employs a robust security architecture that includes authentication using JWTs, authorization using Spring Security roles, and data encryption using AES. These measures ensure that the system remains secure and protected against unauthorized access and data breaches.",

Below, we will detail each major component, explaining their purpose and role in the system.\n\n1. App.java\n\nPurpose: The App.java class serves as the entry point for the application. It initializes the necessary components and orchestrates the flow of data through the system.\n\n```java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { // Initialize dependencies TextParser parser = new TextParser(); WordCounter counter = new WordCounter(); OutputFormatter formatter = new OutputFormatter();\n\n    // Read input file and parse text\n    String inputText = parser.readInputFile(\"input.txt\");\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = counter.countWords(inputText);\n\n    // Format and output results\n    List<String> sortedWordCounts = formatter.sortAndFormat(wordCounts);\n    for (String line : sortedWordCounts) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/App.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n2. TextParser.java\n\nPurpose: The TextParser.java class is responsible for reading the input text file and preparing it for further processing.\n\njava public class TextParser { public String readInputFile(String filePath) { // Read the contents of the input.txt file return new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(filePath))); } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/TextParser.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n3. WordCounter.java\n\nPurpose: The WordCounter.java class counts the occurrences of each word in the input text, ignoring numbers and special characters.\n\njava public class WordCounter { public Map<String, Integer> countWords(String text) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); String[] words = text.split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word.toLowerCase(), wordCounts.getOrDefault(word.toLowerCase(), 0) + 1); } } return wordCounts; } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/WordCounter.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n4. OutputFormatter.java\n\nPurpose: The OutputFormatter.java class formats the word counts for output, sorting them alphabetically and displaying each word with its count.\n\n```java public class OutputFormatter { public List\n\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : sortedWordCounts) {\n        System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue());\n    }\n    return sortedWordCounts;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/OutputFormatter.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n5. Sort.java\n\nPurpose: The Sort.java class contains a simple insertion sort algorithm to sort the words alphabetically.\n\njava public class Sort { public static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) { ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array)); for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) { String key = list.get(i); int j = i - 1; while (j >= 0 && list.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) { list.set(j + 1, list.get(j)); j--; } list.set(j + 1, key); } return list; } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/Sort.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n6. Pair.java\n\nPurpose: The Pair.java class is a utility class that holds pairs of values, which could be used in various parts of the system for storing related data.\n\n```java public class Pair\n\npublic Pair(K key, V value) {\n    this.key = key;\n    this.value = value;\n}\n\npublic K getKey() {\n    return key;\n}\n\npublic V getValue() {\n    return value;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/Pair.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n7.

        "page_content": "Unit Testing Tools\n\nUnit Testing Tools\n\nCountYourWords uses a robust suite of unit testing tools to ensure the reliability and correctness of its components. The primary tools used are JUnit 4.13.2 and Hamcrest Core 1.3, which provide comprehensive support for writing and running tests.\n\nJUnit 4.13.2\n\nJUnit is a widely-used framework for writing repeatable tests in Java. It provides annotations to define test methods and lifecycle callbacks that allow developers to set up and tear down test environments before and after each test.\n\nKey Features of JUnit\n\nAnnotations: @Test marks a method as a test case.\n\nAssertions: Methods like assertEquals, assertTrue, and assertFalse are used to validate the expected outcomes.\n\nSetup and Teardown: @Before and @After annotations allow for code to run before and after each test, respectively.\n\nExample JUnit Test\n\njava @Test public void sortEmptyTest() { HashMap<String, Integer> emptyMap = new HashMap<>(); ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(emptyMap); assertTrue(\"Array should be empty\", sortedArray.isEmpty()); }\n\nHamcrest Core 1.3\n\nHamcrest is a library that provides matchers for assertions in JUnit and other testing frameworks. It allows for more expressive and readable test conditions.\n\nKey Features of Hamcrest\n\nMatchers: Predicates that can be used to check the properties of objects.\n\nReadability: Provides a fluent API for constructing complex assertions.\n\nExample Hamcrest Matcher\n\njava assertThat(sortedArray, empty());\n\nIntegration into Development Process\n\nUnit tests are integrated into the development process through several key practices: 1.

The system follows a clear sequence from input to output, ensuring that each stage is well-defined and easily testable.\n\nInput Stage\n\nThe input stage begins with the user providing a file path through the console. This is handled by the main method in the App.java class:\n\n```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \");\n\n// Reading File name\nString path = \"\";\ntry {\n    path = br.readLine();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);\nPair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\nArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond());\nSystem.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst());\nfor (String line : finaList) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nProcessing Stage\n\nThe processing stage involves three main steps: 1. Reading the File: The readFile method in the CountYourWords.java class reads the file specified by the user and returns an ArrayList<String> containing each line of the file. 2. Counting Words: The count method processes the list of lines, counting the occurrences of each word and returning a Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>>. The first element of the pair is the total number of words, and the second is a map where keys are words and values are their counts. 3. Sorting Words: The sort method takes the map of word counts and sorts them by frequency in descending order, returning an ArrayList<String>.\n\nOutput Stage\n\nThe output stage displays the results to the user. This includes: - The total number of words. - A sorted list of words with their frequencies.\n\nHere is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the data flow:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[User Input] --> B[App.java - main]; B --> C[CountYourWords.java - readFile]; C --> D{File Read}; D -- Success --> E[ArrayList<String> fileLines]; D -- Failure --> F[Exception Handling]; E --> G[CountYourWords.java - count]; G --> H{Word Counting}; H -- Success --> I[Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> wordTotalCount]; H -- Failure --> J[Exception Handling]; I --> K[CountYourWords.java - sort]; K --> L{Sorting Words}; L -- Success --> M[ArrayList<String> finaList]; L -- Failure --> N[Exception Handling]; M --> O[Output Results to User];\n\nSummary\n\nThe data flow in CountYourWords is a straightforward process that involves reading a file, counting words, sorting them by frequency, and displaying the results. Each stage is clearly defined and handled by specific methods within the project. This design ensures modularity, testability, and maintainability of the system.",

Below are the details of the specific versions and features utilized in CountYourWords.\n\nJava Version\n\nCountYourWords is built on Java version 11 (JDK 11). This version was chosen for its balance between performance, security, and feature set, making it suitable for both development and production environments.\n\njava // Example of setting the Java version in a build tool like Maven <properties> <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source> <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target> </properties>\n\nKey Libraries and Dependencies\n\nHamcrest Core (Version 1.3)\n\nHamcrest is used for writing readable assertions in tests. It provides a more expressive way to write test cases compared to traditional JUnit assertions.\n\n```java // Example of using Hamcrest in a test case import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;\n\n@Test public void testSingleLine() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertThat(result.getFirst(), equalTo(2));\n\n} ```\n\nJUnit 4 (Version 4.13.2)\n\nJUnit is the de-facto standard for writing repeatable tests in Java. It provides a simple and flexible framework to create and run tests.\n\n```java // Example of a JUnit test class import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\n    assertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\n    assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n}\n\n} ```\n\nProgramming Language Features Utilized\n\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n\nCountYourWords is designed using OOP principles. It includes classes such as CountYourWords, Sort, and Pair to encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability.\n\n```java // Example of a simple class in CountYourWords public class CountYourWords { public static Pair count(ArrayList\n\npublic static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    // Implementation details\n}\n\n} ```\n\nGenerics\n\nGenerics are used extensively to ensure type safety and reduce the need for casting.\n\n```java // Example of using generics in CountYourWords public class Pair\n\npublic Pair(T first, R second) {\n    this.first = first;\n    this.second = second;\n}\n\n// Getters and setters\n\n} ```\n\nLambda Expressions and Streams\n\nLambda expressions and streams are used to simplify data processing and manipulation.\n\njava // Example of using lambda expressions and streams in CountYourWords public static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) { return wordCounts.entrySet().stream() .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue(Comparator.reverseOrder())) .map(entry -> entry.getKey() + \" \" + entry.getValue()) .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new)); }\n\nConclusion\n\nCountYourWords is a well-structured Java application that leverages modern language features and popular libraries to ensure robustness, readability, and maintainability. The use of Java 11, Hamcrest, and JUnit contributes to the project's reliability and ease of testing.",

The process involves reading the file path provided by the user, validating it, and then preparing the text data for word counting.\n\nReceiving User Input\n\nThe user input is handled in the App.java class within the main method:\n\n```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \");\n\n// Reading File name\nString path = \"\";\ntry {\n    path = br.readLine();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\n} ```\n\nThis code snippet reads a file path from the user and stores it in the path variable. The BufferedReader is used to handle input from the standard input stream.\n\nValidating User Input\n\nThe validation of the user-provided file path is implicitly handled by the subsequent method calls that attempt to read the file:\n\njava ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);\n\nIf the file does not exist or cannot be accessed, a FileNotFoundException will be thrown. This exception handling ensures that only valid file paths are processed.\n\nPreparing Input for Word Counting\n\nOnce the file is successfully read, the lines of text are passed to the count method in the CountYourWords.java class:\n\njava Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nThe count method processes each line of text, counting the occurrences of each word. It uses a HashMap<String, Integer> to store the word counts.\n\nData Structures Used\n\nThe primary data structure used in this section is the HashMap<String, Integer>. This map stores words as keys and their respective counts as values. The Pair class is also used to encapsulate two pieces of related information: the total number of words and the word count map:\n\n```java public final class Pair { private final int totalCount; private final HashMap\n\npublic Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) {\n    this.totalCount = first;\n    this.wordCounts = second;\n}\n\npublic int getFirst() {\n    return totalCount;\n}\n\npublic HashMap<String, Integer> getSecond() {\n    return wordCounts;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nThe Pair class provides a convenient way to return two values from the count method.\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nHere is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data through the Input Processing section:\n\nmermaid graph TD A[User Input] --> B{Validate File Path} B -- Valid --> C[Read File Lines] B -- Invalid --> D[Error Handling] C --> E[Count Words] E --> F[Return Word Count and Total] F --> G[Display Results]\n\nThis diagram shows the sequence of operations from user input to displaying the word count results.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Input Processing section in CountYourWords handles user input, validates it, and prepares the text data for word counting. The use of HashMap<String, Integer> and the Pair class ensures that the word counts are efficiently stored and returned.",

        "page_content": "Data Processing Pipeline\n\nData Processing Pipeline\n\nThe Data Processing Pipeline in CountYourWords is a sequence of steps that transform raw input into processed output. This pipeline consists of several stages, each with a specific role in processing the data. Below, we will outline each stage and detail any intermediate data transformations or calculations.\n\n1. Reading Input File\n\nThe first step in the pipeline is reading the input file. The App class prompts the user to enter a file path and reads the contents of the specified file using the readFile method from the CountYourWords class.\n\njava public static ArrayList<String> readFile(String path) throws FileNotFoundException { ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>(); try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) { String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { lines.add(line); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } return lines; }\n\nSource: App.java, PK: ac863f346e618f9a959b5c95d5d28941\n\n2. Counting Words\n\nThe next stage is counting the words in the input file. The count method from the CountYourWords class processes each line, splits it into words, and counts their occurrences.\n\n```java public static Pair count(ArrayList\n\nfor (String line : lines) {\n    String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty() && !Character.isDigit(word.charAt(0))) {\n            word = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n            totalWords++;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nreturn new Pair(totalWords, wordCount);\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n3. Sorting Words\n\nAfter counting the words, the next step is sorting them by frequency. The sort method from the Sort class implements a custom sorting algorithm to sort the word counts.\n\n```java public static ArrayList\n\nArrayList<String> sortedList = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) {\n    sortedList.add(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n\nreturn sortedList;\n\n} ```\n\nSource: Sort.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n4. Outputting Results\n\nFinally, the processed data is outputted to the console. The main method in the App class prints the total number of words and each word's count.\n\n```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \");\nString path = \"\";\ntry {\n    path = br.readLine();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(path);\nPair wordTotalCount = count(fileLines);\nArrayList<String> finaList = sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond());\nSystem.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst());\nfor (String line : finaList) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: App.java, PK: ac863f346e618f9a959b5c95d5d28941\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data through the Data Processing Pipeline:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[Read Input File] --> B[Count Words]; B --> C[Sort Words]; C --> D[Output Results];\n\nThis diagram shows the sequence of steps from reading the input file to outputting the results, highlighting each stage in the pipeline.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Data Processing Pipeline in CountYourWords is a structured approach to transforming raw input into processed output. Each stage plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data is accurately counted and sorted before being presented to the user. By following this pipeline, the application meets its goal of providing a robust solution for word count analysis while adhering to the specified constraints and requirements.",

        "page_content": "Result Formatting\n\nResult Formatting\n\nThe Result Formatting section describes how the word count results are formatted for display. The primary goal is to ensure that the output is clear, consistent, and easy to understand.\n\nOutput Structure\n\nThe result of a word count operation is typically structured as a Pair object, where the first element represents the total number of words and the second element is a HashMap containing the frequency of each word. This structure allows for both a summary statistic and detailed breakdown of the word distribution.\n\n```java public class Pair { private int first; private HashMap\n\npublic Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) {\n    this.first = first;\n    this.second = second;\n}\n\n// Getters and setters\n\n} ```\n\nFormatting Rules\n\nTotal Word Count: The total word count is displayed at the top of the output.\n\nWord Frequency Table: A table is generated to show each unique word along with its frequency.\n\nExample Output\n\nGiven a file with the following content:\n\nHello world This is a test. World of Java!\n\nThe output might look like this:\n\n```plaintext Total Words: 9\n\nWord Frequency hello 1 world 2 this 1 is 1 a 1 test 1 of 1 java 1 ```\n\nCode Implementation\n\nThe CountYourWords class contains the logic to perform the word count and format the output. Below is an example implementation:\n\n```java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair count(ArrayList\n\n    for (String line : fileLines) {\n        String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        totalWords += words.length;\n\n        for (String word : words) {\n            word = word.toLowerCase().replaceAll(\"[^a-z0-9]\", \"\");\n            if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n                wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    return new Pair(totalWords, wordCounts);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTesting\n\nTo ensure the formatting is correct, unit tests are provided. Below is an example test case:\n\n```java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testMultipleLines() { ArrayList\n\n    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\n    assertEquals(9, result.getFirst());\n\n    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\n    expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\n    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nTo visualize the flow of data through the CountYourWords class, a Mermaid diagram can be used:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[Input: ArrayList<String> fileLines] --> B{Split lines into words}; B -- Word count --> C[Initialize totalWords = 0]; B -- Word frequency --> D[Initialize wordCounts = new HashMap()]; C --> E[Increment totalWords by number of words in line]; D --> F[For each word: Convert to lowercase, remove non-alphanumeric characters, and update wordCounts]; E --> G{Next line}; G -- Yes --> B; G -- No --> H[Return Pair(totalWords, wordCounts)];\n\nThis diagram shows the high-level flow of data through the CountYourWords class, from input to output.",

        "page_content": "Case Sensitivity Handling Case Sensitivity Handling The CountYourWords algorithm handles case sensitivity by treating words in a case-insensitive manner. This means that words like \"word\" and \"Word\" are counted as the same word, resulting in a total count of 1 for both occurrences. Implementation Details To achieve this, the algorithm uses a HashMap<String, Integer> to store word counts. When processing each line of text, it splits the line into individual words using whitespace as the delimiter. Each word is then converted to lowercase before being added to the map. This ensures that all variations of the same word (e.g., \"apple\", \"Apple\", \"APPLE\") are counted together. Here is a simplified example of how this might be implemented in Java: ```java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair for (String line : fileLines) { String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\"); for (String word : words) { // Convert word to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity String lowerCaseWord = word.toLowerCase(); wordCounts.put(lowerCaseWord, wordCounts.getOrDefault(lowerCaseWord, 0) + 1); } } return new Pair<>(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts); } } ``` Testing Case Sensitivity To verify that the case-insensitivity handling works as expected, a test method named testCaseInsensitivity is provided in the CountYourWordsTest class. This test adds a line with multiple occurrences of \"apple\" (in different cases) to an ArrayList. It then calls the count() method and asserts that the total word count is 4 and that the word counts are case-insensitive. ```java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(4, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } } ``` Mermaid Diagram To better visualize the flow of data through the count() method, a simple Mermaid diagram can be used: mermaid graph TD; A[Input: ArrayList<String> fileLines] --> B{Split line into words}; B -- Word is \"apple\" --> C{Convert to lowercase}; C -- Lowercase word is \"apple\" --> D[Update word count in HashMap]; D --> E[Repeat for all words and lines]; E --> F[Return Pair with total word count and word counts map]; This diagram shows the key steps involved in counting words, including splitting lines into words, converting them to lowercase, updating the word count map, and returning the results.",

The system reads these files from disk and processes their contents to count words and sort them. Example File Structure The project includes several test files located in src/test/textTests/: emptyFile.txt: An empty file used for testing edge cases. exampleFile.txt: A sample text file containing multiple lines of text. nonPeriodFile.txt: A file without periods, which is handled by the system. validFile.txt: A valid text file with typical content. Code Example: Reading a File Below is an example of how the CountYourWords class reads a file into an ArrayList<String>: java public static ArrayList<String> readFile(String filePath) { ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>(); try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { fileLines.add(line); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } return fileLines; } Source: CountYourWords.java, PK: 5eaef14f997e9bade8f52072d6f161e7 This method reads each line from the specified file and adds it to an ArrayList. It handles exceptions gracefully, ensuring that any I/O errors are logged. Database Usage CountYourWords does not use a traditional database for storing word counts. Instead, it uses in-memory data structures such as HashMap to store and manage word counts efficiently. Example Code: Counting Words The following code snippet demonstrates how the CountYourWords class counts words in a list of strings: java public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String line : fileLines) { String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { word = word.toLowerCase(); if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } } return new Pair<>(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts); } Source: CountYourWords.java, PK: 5eaef14f997e9bade8f52072d6f161e7 This method splits each line into words, counts their occurrences, and stores them in a HashMap. The Pair class is used to return both the total number of unique words and the word count map.",

This section delves into the features related to analyzing text, such as frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction. Frequency Analysis Frequency analysis is a fundamental technique used to determine how often each word appears in a given text. CountYourWords uses this feature to provide insights into the distribution of words within a document. The following code snippet demonstrates how frequency analysis can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class FrequencyAnalyzer { public static Map for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } return wordCount; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\"; Map<String, Integer> frequencyMap = analyzeFrequency(text); System.out.println(frequencyMap); } } ``` Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. CountYourWords utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis. The following code snippet illustrates how sentiment analysis can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class SentimentAnalyzer { private static final Map static { sentimentScores.put(\"happy\", 1); sentimentScores.put(\"sad\", -1); sentimentScores.put(\"angry\", -2); sentimentScores.put(\"excited\", 2); } public static int analyzeSentiment(String text) { String[] words = text.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\"); int sentimentScore = 0; for (String word : words) { if (sentimentScores.containsKey(word)) { sentimentScore += sentimentScores.get(word); } } return sentimentScore; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"I am very happy today. The weather is beautiful.\"; int sentiment = analyzeSentiment(text); System.out.println(\"Sentiment Score: \" + sentiment); } } ``` Keyword Extraction Keyword extraction involves identifying the most important words or phrases in a piece of text. CountYourWords uses techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract keywords. The following code snippet demonstrates how keyword extraction can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class KeywordExtractor { public static Map for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } double totalWords = wordCount.size(); Map<String, Double> keywordScores = new HashMap<>(); for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) { String word = entry.getKey(); int count = entry.getValue(); double score = (count / totalWords) * Math.log(totalWords / 1.0); // Simplified TF-IDF keywordScores.put(word, score); } return keywordScores; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.

This strategy includes both unit tests and integration tests, leveraging JUnit 4.13.2 for assertions. Unit Tests Unit tests are designed to validate individual methods or functions within the application. The primary focus is on the CountYourWords class and its associated helper methods. Below are some key unit test cases: Sorting Algorithm The sorting algorithm in CountYourWords.sort() method is tested using JUnit. Here’s an example of a unit test for sorting an empty map: java @Test public void sortEmptyTest() { HashMap<String, Integer> emptyMap = new HashMap<>(); ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(emptyMap); assertTrue(\"Array should be empty\", sortedArray.isEmpty()); } This test ensures that the sorting method returns an empty list when provided with an empty map. Word Counting The CountYourWords.count() method is tested to ensure it correctly counts words in different scenarios. Here’s a unit test for counting words in a single line: ```java @Test public void testSingleLine() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(\"Total words should be 2\", 2, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1); assertEquals(\"Word counts should match expected counts\", expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } ``` This test verifies that the word count is accurate and that the map of word counts contains the correct entries. Integration Tests Integration tests are used to verify the interaction between different components or modules. For CountYourWords, integration tests focus on testing the end-to-end functionality using real text files. Testing with Empty File The CountYourWords.count() method is tested with an empty file: ```java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList assertEquals(\"Total words should be 0\", 0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(\"Word counts map should be empty\", result.getSecond().isEmpty()); } ``` This test ensures that the method handles an empty file correctly. Testing with Multiple Lines The CountYourWords.count() method is tested with multiple lines of text: ```java @Test public void testMultipleLines() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(\"Total words should be 9\", 9, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2); expectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1); assertEquals(\"Word counts should match expected counts\", expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } ``` This test ensures that the method correctly counts words across multiple lines.",

        "page_content": "Sorting Mechanisms Sorting Mechanisms The CountYourWords project utilizes a sorting mechanism to organize word count results before presentation. This ensures that the output is not only accurate but also easy to interpret, with words presented in ascending order based on their frequency. Overview of the Sorting Algorithm The primary sorting algorithm used in CountYourWords is an insertion sort. This method is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency for smaller datasets, which is typical for word count results. The insertion sort algorithm works by iterating through the list, comparing each element with the ones before it, and inserting it into the correct position. Implementation Details The sorting logic is encapsulated in the CountYourWords.sort method, located in the CountYourWords.java file. Below is a detailed breakdown of this method: ```java public static ArrayList // Now to add the values back for (String word : sortedWords) { String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word)); String fString = word + \" \" + value; sortedWordCounts.add(fString); } return sortedWordCounts; } ``` Key Points: - Input: The method takes a HashMap<String, Integer> where keys are words and values are their counts. - Output: It returns an ArrayList<String> containing strings of sorted words with their counts. - Sorting Logic: Words are first extracted from the HashMap and sorted using the Sort.insertionSort method. Each word is then combined with its count to form a string, which is added to the result list. Testing the Sorting Mechanism To ensure the sorting mechanism works as expected, comprehensive tests are provided in the CountYourWordsTest.java file. Below are some key test cases: ```java @Test public void sortSingleTest() { HashMap @Test public void sortMultipleTest() { HashMap List<String> expectedKeys = Arrays.asList(\"apple 1\", \"banana 1\", \"cherry 1\"); List<String> actualKeys = sortedArray; assertEquals(\"Keys should be sorted\", expectedKeys, actualKeys); } ``` Key Points: - sortSingleTest: Tests sorting with a single word. - sortMultipleTest: Tests sorting with multiple words and verifies the order.",

        "page_content": "Frameworks and Libraries Frameworks and Libraries The CountYourWords project relies on several frameworks and libraries to facilitate its development. These tools enhance various aspects of the application, from testing and assertions to sorting algorithms. Hamcrest Core (hamcrest-core-1.3.jar) Purpose: Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects in Java. It provides a more readable way to assert conditions in tests compared to traditional JUnit assertions. Role: This library is used extensively for creating custom matchers in the test suite, making it easier to write expressive and maintainable test cases. JUnit (junit-4.13.2.jar) Purpose: JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java applications. It allows developers to write repeatable tests that validate their code. Role: The CountYourWords project uses JUnit to create unit tests for its core functionality, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under various conditions. Custom Libraries and Classes In addition to external libraries, the CountYourWords project includes several custom classes and utilities: Pair Class (src/main/Pair.java) Purpose: The Pair class is a simple utility class used to store two related objects together. It is particularly useful in sorting algorithms where pairs of words and their counts need to be maintained. Role: This class simplifies the handling of word-count pairs, making the code more readable and maintainable. Sort Class (src/main/Sort.java) Purpose: The Sort class contains various sorting algorithms. Currently, it includes an insertion sort implementation, which is used to sort words alphabetically before counting their occurrences. Role: This class encapsulates the logic for sorting operations, ensuring that the main application logic remains clean and focused on word processing. Example Code Snippets Below are some example code snippets demonstrating the use of these frameworks and libraries: Hamcrest Matcher Example (src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java) ```java import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo; public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { // Arrange String input = \"hello world hello\"; CountYourWords countYourWords = new CountYourWords(); // Act Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = countYourWords.countWords(input); // Assert assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"hello\"), equalTo(2)); assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"world\"), equalTo(1)); } } ```",

        "page_content": "User Interface Features User Interface Features CountYourWords provides a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to interact with the text parsing functionality. The primary components of the user interface include: Console Input/Output The application reads input from a fixed file named input.txt located in the project directory. The output is displayed directly in the console, showing the total number of words and their occurrences. Code Example: ```java // Main class to read input and display results public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) { HashMap private static void processLine(String line, HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) { String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { word = word.toLowerCase(); wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } } } ``` File Handling The application handles file reading and writing operations. It reads from input.txt and writes the results to the console.

        "page_content": "Output Generation Output Generation The Output Generation section of CountYourWords is responsible for formatting and presenting the word count results to the user. This process involves several key steps, including sorting and filtering the word counts before final presentation. Sorting Word Counts Word counts are sorted based on their frequency in descending order. The sorting logic is implemented in the Sort.java file. Below is a code snippet demonstrating the sorting method: ```java public class Sort { public static ArrayList // Sort the list based on value (frequency) Collections.sort(list, new Comparator<Map.Entry<String, Integer>>() { public int compare(Map.Entry<String, Integer> o1, Map.Entry<String, Integer> o2) { return (o2.getValue()).compareTo(o1.getValue()); } }); // Convert sorted list back to ArrayList of strings ArrayList<String> sortedList = new ArrayList<>(); for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) { sortedList.add(entry.getKey() + \" \" + entry.getValue()); } return sortedList; } } ``` Explanation: 1. Conversion to List: The HashMap of word counts is converted into a List of entries. 2. Sorting: The list is sorted using Collections.sort() with a custom comparator that compares the values (frequencies) in descending order. 3. Conversion Back to ArrayList: The sorted list is then converted back into an ArrayList<String> where each element represents a word and its count. Filtering Word Counts Filtering is not explicitly implemented in the current version of CountYourWords, but it could be added if needed. For example, one might want to filter out words that appear less than a certain number of times or exclude common stop words. Presentation of Results The final step in output generation is presenting the sorted word counts to the user. This is handled by the main method in the App.java file: ```java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); System.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \"); // Reading File name String path = \"\"; try { path = br.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path); Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); ArrayList<String> finaList = Sort.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond()); System.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst()); for (String line : finaList) { System.out.println(line); } } } ``` Explanation: 1. User Input: The user is prompted to enter the file path. 2. File Reading and Counting: The readFile method reads the file, and the count method counts the words. 3. Sorting: The word counts are sorted using the Sort.sort() method. 4. Output: The total number of words and the sorted list are printed to the console.",

        "page_content": "Word Counting Algorithm Word Counting Algorithm The CountYourWords project includes a robust word counting algorithm that processes input text to count occurrences of each word. This algorithm is crucial for various applications such as text analysis, SEO optimization, and natural language processing. Tokenization Tokenization is the process of breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords algorithm uses a simple yet effective tokenization method: java public static ArrayList<String> tokenize(String text) { return new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\s+\"))); } This method splits the input text using whitespace as the delimiter and returns an ArrayList of tokens. Case Sensitivity Handling The algorithm handles case sensitivity by converting all words to lowercase before counting. This ensures that words like \"Hello\" and \"hello\" are counted as the same word: java public static HashMap<String, Integer> countWords(ArrayList<String> tokens) { HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String token : tokens) { String lowerCaseToken = token.toLowerCase(); wordCounts.put(lowerCaseToken, wordCounts.getOrDefault(lowerCaseToken, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; } Punctuation Rules The algorithm ignores punctuation when counting words. For example, \"hello,\" and \"hello\" are considered the same word: java public static ArrayList<String> cleanTokens(ArrayList<String> tokens) { ArrayList<String> cleanedTokens = new ArrayList<>(); for (String token : tokens) { if (!token.matches(\"[^a-zA-Z0-9]+\")) { cleanedTokens.add(token.toLowerCase()); } } return cleanedTokens; } This method filters out any tokens that contain non-alphanumeric characters, ensuring that only words are counted. Putting It All Together The CountYourWords algorithm combines these steps to count the occurrences of each word in a given text: java public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { ArrayList<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>(); for (String line : fileLines) { tokens.addAll(cleanTokens(tokenize(line))); } int totalWords = tokens.size(); HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = countWords(tokens); return new Pair<>(totalWords, wordCounts); } This method processes each line of the input text, cleans and tokenizes it, counts the words, and returns a Pair containing the total number of words and a map of word frequencies.",

        "page_content": "Filtering Criteria Filtering Criteria The CountYourWords project includes several filtering rules applied to the word count data before it is presented to the user. These filters ensure that the output is accurate and meaningful, adhering to specific requirements and constraints. Case Insensitivity One of the primary filtering criteria is case insensitivity. The system ensures that words are counted without considering their case (e.g., \"apple\" and \"Apple\" are considered the same word). This is crucial for providing a more comprehensive word count analysis. Example Usage: ```java @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(4, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } ``` Explanation: In the example above, the testCaseInsensitivity method tests the case insensitivity of word counting. It adds a line with multiple occurrences of \"apple\" (in different cases) to an ArrayList. The CountYourWords.count() method is then called with this list, and it returns a Pair containing the total word count and the word counts map. The test asserts that the total word count is 4 and that the word counts are case-insensitive. This ensures that all occurrences of \"apple\" are counted as one. Empty File Handling Another important filtering rule is handling empty files. If a file is empty, the system should return a total word count of 0 and an empty map for word counts. Example Usage: ```java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty()); } ``` Explanation: The testEmptyFile method tests the handling of empty files. It creates an empty ArrayList and calls the CountYourWords.count() method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 0 and that the word counts map is empty. This ensures that the system correctly handles cases where no words are present in the file, providing a consistent and meaningful output.",

It creates an ArrayList containing a single line and calls the CountYourWords.count() method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 2 and that the word counts match the expected values. This ensures that the system correctly handles cases where words are present in a single line, providing accurate and meaningful output. Multiple Lines Handling Finally, the system includes filtering rules for handling files with multiple lines. It should accurately count the words across all lines and return the correct word counts. Example Usage: ```java @Test public void testMultipleLines() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(9, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2); expectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } ``` Explanation: The testMultipleLines method tests the handling of files with multiple lines.

        "page_content": "Input Handling Input Handling Overview User input is a crucial aspect of any application, especially one like CountYourWords that processes text files. The input handling process in CountYourWords involves receiving user input, validating it, and storing it in appropriate data structures before further processing. Receiving User Input The primary method for receiving user input in CountYourWords is through the main method in the App.java file: ```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); System.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \"); // Reading File name String path = \"\"; try { path = br.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path); Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); ArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond()); System.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst()); for (String line : finaList) { System.out.println(line); } } ``` This method prompts the user to enter a file path and reads it from standard input. The readFile method in the CountYourWords.java class is then called with this path to read the contents of the file. Validating User Input Input validation is essential to ensure that the application handles invalid or unexpected inputs gracefully. In CountYourWords, the primary validation step occurs when reading the user input: java String path = \"\"; try { path = br.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } If an IOException is thrown during this process, it indicates that there was a problem with reading from standard input. In a production environment, you would want to handle this exception more gracefully, possibly by prompting the user again or providing an error message. Storing Input Data The input data, which in this case is the contents of a text file, is stored in an ArrayList<String>: java ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path); This list holds each line of the file as a separate element. The readFile method reads the file and populates this list.",

        "page_content": "Introduction to CountYourWords Introduction CountYourWords is a Java project designed as a text parser that processes an input file (input.txt) to count words and their occurrences. The project adheres to specific constraints, including ignoring numbers, special characters, and case sensitivity. The goal of the project is to produce production-ready code with comprehensive testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Additionally, the application must be designed following SOLID principles and object-oriented programming practices. Project Structure The CountYourWords project has a structured file tree as follows: CountYourWords/ ├── lib/ │ ├── hamcrest-core-1.3.jar │ └── junit-4.13.2.jar ├── readme.md ├── src/ │ ├── main/ │ │ ├── App.java │ │ ├── CountYourWords.java │ │ ├── Pair.java │ │ └── Sort.java │ └── test/ │ ├── CountYourWordsTest.java │ ├── SortTest.java │ └── textTests/ │ ├── emptyFile.txt │ ├── exampleFile.txt │ ├── nonPeriodFile.txt │ └── validFile.txt Key Components 1. readme.md This file provides a detailed overview of the project, including its description, constraints, and goals. It serves as the primary documentation for developers. Example Content: ```markdown Project Description I am creating a text parser in Java named CountYourWords. Constraints Numbers in the document are ignored and are not processed Other characters than words should be filtered out of the input, so ## or @ or !! are ignored You do not have to take in account strange combinations like: love4u or mail@address.nl, combinations like these are out of scope for this assignment Next to showing the total number of words in the document, the number of occurrences of each word is also calculated The total number of occurrences next to the word must be shown on screen one by one (in lowercase) Counting the occurrences per word is case insensitive (so Matchbox, matchbox, and MATCHBOX are all the same word) When printing the occurrences, the words must be in alphabetical order You cannot use a built-in .NET sort routine, so produce on of your own, it does not have to be the fastest sort-routine as long as it is reliable end reusable. The document is a text file that will be read by your console app and has the fixed name: input.txt Goal The code must be production code, use everything you would use in production. You are allowed to use third party components if required (except for the sorting) All classes can be in one .NET core console application (assembly), as long as you show clear separation Everything must be done using testing and TDD Use SOLID and object-oriented programming ```",

        "page_content": "Core System Components Core System Components The CountYourWords application is composed of several key components that work together to process input text, count words, and generate output. Below, we will detail each component in depth. Input Processing Input processing involves reading the contents of input.txt and preparing it for further processing. This step ensures that only valid words are considered, ignoring numbers and special characters. Code Snippet: ```java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { String input = readFile(\"input.txt\"); List private static String readFile(String fileName) throws IOException { return new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(fileName))); } private static List<String> preprocess(String input) { return Arrays.asList(input.replaceAll(\"[^a-zA-Z ]\", \"\").toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\s+\")); } } ``` Explanation: - readFile: Reads the contents of input.txt and returns it as a string. - preprocess: Removes non-alphabetic characters, converts the text to lowercase, and splits it into individual words. Word Counting Word counting involves counting the occurrences of each word in the preprocessed list. This step uses a HashMap to store word counts efficiently. Code Snippet: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java private static Map<String, Integer> countWords(List<String> words) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String word : words) { wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; } Explanation: - countWords: Iterates through the list of words and updates a HashMap with the count of each word. Output Generation Output generation involves sorting the word counts alphabetically and formatting them for display. This step uses a custom sort algorithm to ensure reliability and reusability. Code Snippet: java // src/main/Sort.java public class Sort { public static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] words) { ArrayList<String> sortedWords = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(words)); for (int i = 1; i < sortedWords.size(); i++) { String key = sortedWords.get(i); int j = i - 1; while (j >= 0 && sortedWords.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) { sortedWords.set(j + 1, sortedWords.get(j)); j--; } sortedWords.set(j + 1, key); } return sortedWords; } } Explanation: - insertionSort: Implements the insertion sort algorithm to sort an array of words alphabetically.",

These integration points are crucial for understanding how various parts of the system interact with each other and with external resources. Internal Component Integration The primary internal component in CountYourWords is the CountYourWords class, which handles the main logic for counting words in a text file. This class interacts with several other components: Pair Class: The Pair class is used to store and return results from word count operations. It encapsulates two values: a total count of words and a HashMap mapping each word to its frequency. ```java public final class Pair { private final int totalCount; private final HashMap public Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) { this.totalCount = first; this.wordCounts = second; } public int getFirst() { return totalCount; } public HashMap<String, Integer> getSecond() { return wordCounts; } } ``` Sort Class: The Sort class is responsible for sorting the results based on word frequency. It takes a Pair object as input and returns a sorted list of words. java public class Sort { public List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> sort(Pair pair) { List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entries = new ArrayList<>(pair.getSecond().entrySet()); Collections.sort(entries, (e1, e2) -> e2.getValue().compareTo(e1.getValue())); return entries; } } External System Integration CountYourWords interacts with external systems primarily through file operations. The project includes several test files located in the src/test/textTests directory: emptyFile.txt: An empty file used to test edge cases. exampleFile.txt: A sample text file containing words for word count. nonPeriodFile.txt: A file without periods, which might affect word separation logic. validFile.txt: A valid text file with proper formatting. These files are read by the CountYourWords class to perform word counting operations. The project also includes test cases in the src/test/java/CountYourWordsTest.java and src/test/java/SortTest.java files, which utilize these external resources to validate the functionality of the system.",

The specific test coverage targets are outlined below: 1. Code Coverage Target Our primary goal is to achieve a minimum code coverage of 90% across all source files. This target ensures that the majority of the application's functionality is tested, reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving overall software quality. Example: java // CountYourWords.java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { // Implementation details... } } 2. Unit Test Coverage Target For each unit (method or function), we aim to achieve a minimum of 80% coverage. This ensures that individual components are thoroughly tested and behave as expected. Example: ```java // CountYourWordsTest.java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList assertEquals(\"Total words should be 0\", 0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(\"Word counts map should be empty\", result.getSecond().isEmpty()); } } ``` 3. Integration Test Coverage Target Integration tests are crucial for ensuring that different components of the application work together seamlessly. We aim to achieve a minimum of 70% coverage in integration tests. Example: ```java // SortTest.java public class SortTest { @Test public void sortMultipleTest() { HashMap List<String> expectedKeys = Arrays.asList(\"apple 1\", \"banana 1\", \"cherry 1\"); List<String> actualKeys = sortedArray; assertEquals(\"Keys should be sorted\", expectedKeys, actualKeys); } } ``` 4. Test Coverage Metrics To measure and track our progress towards these goals, we use several metrics: Line Coverage: The percentage of lines executed during tests. Branch Coverage: The percentage of branches (e.g., if statements) that are tested. Method Coverage: The percentage of methods that have at least one test case. 5. Test Coverage Tools We utilize tools like JaCoCo and SonarQube to automatically measure and report on our test coverage. These tools help us identify untested code and ensure continuous improvement in our testing strategy. Example JaCoCo Configuration: xml <plugin> <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId> <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId> <version>0.8.7</version> <executions> <execution> <goals> <goal>prepare-agent</goal> </goals> </execution> <execution> <id>report</id> <phase>test</phase> <goals> <goal>report</goal> </goals> </execution> </executions> </plugin> 6.",

It ensures that individual units of code (methods, functions) work as expected before they are integrated into larger components. This approach helps catch bugs early and improves software quality. Tools Used for Unit Testing CountYourWords uses JUnit 4.13.2 for unit testing. JUnit is a widely-used framework for writing repeatable tests in Java. It provides annotations to mark test methods, setup and teardown methods, and assertions to validate the correctness of the code. Dependencies JUnit: Version 4.13.2 Test Coverage Goals The goal for unit testing in CountYourWords is to achieve a high level of code coverage. The target is at least 80% test coverage across all tested classes and methods. This ensures that most of the application's functionality is covered by tests, reducing the risk of bugs. Example Unit Tests Below are examples of unit tests for key functionalities in CountYourWords. Sorting Algorithm Test The sort method sorts a map of word counts into an ordered list. The following test cases ensure that the sorting algorithm works correctly. ```java @Test public void sortEmptyTest() { HashMap @Test public void sortSingleTest() { HashMap @Test public void sortMultipleTest() { HashMap List<String> expectedKeys = Arrays.asList(\"apple 1\", \"banana 1\", \"cherry 1\"); List<String> actualKeys = sortedArray; assertEquals(\"Keys should be sorted\", expectedKeys, actualKeys); } ``` Word Counting Test The count method processes a list of file lines and returns the total word count along with a map of individual word counts. The following test cases ensure that the word counting logic is correct. ```java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList assertEquals(\"Total words should be 0\", 0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(\"Word counts map should be empty\", result.getSecond().isEmpty()); @Test public void testSingleLine() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(\"Total words should be 2\", 2, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1); assertEquals(\"Word counts should match expected counts\", expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); @Test public void testMultipleLines() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(\"Total words should be 9\", 9, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2); expectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1); assertEquals(\"Word counts should match expected counts\", expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } ```",

This process involves several key steps, including tokenization, normalization, and counting. Below, we will delve into the details of how these steps are implemented within the system. Tokenization Tokenization is the first step in word counting. It involves breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords system uses a simple regular expression to identify words: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> tokenize(String text) { return Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\W+\")); } This method splits the input text using any non-word character (\\\\W+) as the delimiter. The resulting list of tokens is then returned.  Counting Word Counting The CountYourWords system is designed to count words in a given text input.

The resulting list of tokens is then returned. Normalization Normalization involves converting all words to a consistent case (typically lowercase) to ensure that word counts are case-insensitive. This step helps in accurately counting occurrences of the same word regardless of its case: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> normalize(List<String> tokens) { return tokens.stream() .map(String::toLowerCase) .collect(Collectors.toList()); } The normalize method takes a list of tokens and converts each token to lowercase using the String.toLowerCase() method. The resulting normalized list is then returned. Counting The counting step involves iterating over the normalized list of words and keeping track of their occurrences. This can be efficiently done using a HashMap: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static Map<String, Integer> count(List<String> tokens) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String token : tokens) { wordCounts.put(token, wordCounts.getOrDefault(token, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; } The count method takes a list of normalized tokens and iterates over each token.

        "page_content": "Edge Cases Handling edge cases is crucial for robust word counting. Some common edge cases include: Empty Input: If the input text is empty, the system should return a count of 0. Punctuation: Punctuation marks should be ignored when counting words. For example, \"hello,\" and \"hello\" should both be counted as \"hello\". Case Insensitivity: The word counting should be case-insensitive, so \"Hello\" and \"hello\" should be treated as the same word. The provided test cases in CountYourWordsTest.java cover these edge cases: ```java // src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList assertEquals(0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty()); @Test public void testPunctuation() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(5, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"welcome\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"to\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(4, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } ``` These test cases ensure that the word counting system handles various edge cases correctly. Performance Considerations For large text inputs, performance can be a concern. The current implementation uses a simple HashMap for counting, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups. However, for very large inputs, this could become a bottleneck. To improve performance, the system could use more advanced data structures or parallel processing techniques. For example, using a concurrent hash map (ConcurrentHashMap) or distributing the counting task across multiple threads could help handle larger inputs more efficiently. Conclusion The CountYourWords system provides a robust solution for counting words in text input. By breaking down the process into tokenization, normalization, and counting, the system ensures accurate word counts while handling various edge cases. The provided test cases validate the correctness of the implementation, and further performance optimizations can be considered for larger inputs.

Example Code: ```java // src/main/Sort.java public class Sort { public static ArrayList ArrayList<String> sortedArray = new ArrayList<>(); for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) { sortedArray.add(entry.getKey() + \" \" + entry.getValue()); } return sortedArray; } } ``` User Interface Features While the primary focus is on backend functionality, CountYourWords also includes a simple user interface to interact with the application. This feature allows users to input file paths and view word counts and their occurrences. Example Code: ```java // src/main/App.java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length == 0) { System.out.println(\"Please provide a file path as an argument.\"); return; } String filePath = args[0]; try { ArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(filePath); Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); ArrayList<String> sortedArray = Sort.sort(result.getSecond()); System.out.println(\"Total words: \" + result.getFirst()); for (String entry : sortedArray) { System.out.println(entry); } } catch (IOException e) { System.err.println(\"Error reading file: \" + e.getMessage()); } } private static ArrayList<String> readFile(String filePath) throws IOException { ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>(); try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { lines.add(line); } } return lines; } } ```",

        "page_content": "Primary Goal Primary Goal The primary goal of CountYourWords is to develop a robust text parser that processes input from a file named input.txt and outputs the total number of words along with their individual occurrences. This project aims to adhere to several key constraints and objectives: Input Processing: The application reads from input.txt, which contains text data. Numbers, special characters, and case sensitivity are ignored during processing. Output Requirements: The total number of words in the document is displayed. Each word's occurrence count is shown on the screen, sorted alphabetically. Word counts are case insensitive (e.g., \"Matchbox\", \"matchbox\", and \"MATCHBOX\" are treated as the same word). Code Quality: The code must be production-ready, using best practices in object-oriented programming and design patterns such as SOLID principles. Testing and TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodologies are strictly enforced to ensure code quality and reliability. Implementation Details: All classes can be contained within a single .NET Core console application. A custom sorting algorithm must be implemented, as built-in sort routines are not allowed. Dependencies: Third-party components may be used except for the sorting functionality, which must be implemented in-house. Example Usage The application processes input.txt and outputs results based on the specified rules. For example, if input.txt contains: Hello world This is a test. World of Java! The output might be: Total words: 9 hello 1 is 1 java 1 of 1 test 1 this 1 world 2 Code Snippets Below are snippets from the CountYourWords project that demonstrate key components of the implementation.

This section outlines the key security measures in place, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption. Authentication Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting them access to the system. In CountYourWords, authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user logs in, they provide their credentials, which are verified against the stored credentials. If the credentials are valid, a JWT is issued and returned to the client. java // Example of JWT generation in Java String token = Jwts.builder() .setSubject(user.getUsername()) .setIssuedAt(new Date()) .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000)) // 1 day validity .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, \"secretKey\") .compact(); The JWT is then used in subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The server verifies the token's signature and expiration before granting access. Authorization Authorization is the process of determining what actions a user can perform within the system. In CountYourWords, authorization is enforced using Spring Security. Each endpoint has associated roles that determine which users are allowed to access it. ```java // Example of securing an endpoint in Spring Security @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/api\") public class WordController { @GetMapping(\"/words\") @PreAuthorize(\"hasRole('USER')\") public List<String> getWords() { // Endpoint logic here } } ``` In this example, the /api/words endpoint is accessible only to users with the USER role. Data Encryption Data encryption is used to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit. In CountYourWords, data is encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) when stored in the database. Additionally, all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS. java // Example of encrypting data using AES in Java public byte[] encrypt(byte[] data, SecretKey secretKey) throws Exception { Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\"); cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey); return cipher.doFinal(data); } The encryption key is securely stored and managed to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt the data.",

The primary mechanism involves reading a file, counting words, sorting them by frequency, and then presenting the results in a readable format. Overview of Output Generation Process File Reading: The application prompts the user to enter a file path and reads the contents of the specified file. Data Processing: Word Counting: Each word is counted, and the total number of words is determined. Sorting: Words are sorted by their frequency in descending order. Output Formatting: The results are formatted into a readable string that includes the total number of words and the sorted list of words with their frequencies. Code Example Below is an example of how the output generation process is implemented in the App class: ```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); System.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \"); // Reading File name String path = \"\"; try { path = br.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path); Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); ArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond()); System.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst()); for (String line : finaList) { System.out.println(line); } } ``` Explanation File Reading: The application reads the file path from the user. It then reads the contents of the file into an ArrayList<String>. Data Processing: The CountYourWords.count method processes the list of lines to count the occurrences of each word. The CountYourWords.sort method sorts these words by their frequency in descending order. Output Formatting: The results are printed to the console, showing the total number of words and a sorted list of words with their frequencies.

This ensures that all modifications are recorded, allowing for collaboration among team members and easy rollback if necessary. Configuration Git is configured with a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control. The .gitignore file includes entries for compiled class files (*.class), IDE-specific configuration files (e.g., .vscode/), and temporary files (*.tmp). This helps keep the repository clean and focused on source code. ```plaintext Ignore compiled Java classes .class Ignore Visual Studio Code specific files .vscode/ Ignore temporary files .tmp ``` Workflow The development workflow in CountYourWords follows a standard Git branching model: Master Branch: This branch contains the production-ready code and is protected against direct commits. Feature Branches: Developers create feature branches for new features or bug fixes. These branches are created from the master branch and merged back into it once completed. Pull Requests (PRs): Before merging a feature branch into master, developers submit a pull request. This allows other team members to review the changes before they are integrated.

The system follows a clear sequence from input to output, ensuring that each stage is well-defined and easily testable. Input Stage The input stage begins with the user providing a file path through the console. This is handled by the main method in the App.java class: ```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); System.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \"); // Reading File name String path = \"\"; try { path = br.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path); Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); ArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond()); System.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst()); for (String line : finaList) { System.out.println(line); } } ``` Processing Stage The processing stage involves three main steps: 1. Reading the File: The readFile method in the CountYourWords.java class reads the file specified by the user and returns an ArrayList<String> containing each line of the file. 2. Counting Words: The count method processes the list of lines, counting the occurrences of each word and returning a Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>>. The first element of the pair is the total number of words, and the second is a map where keys are words and values are their counts. 3. Sorting Words: The sort method takes the map of word counts and sorts them by frequency in descending order, returning an ArrayList<String>. Output Stage The output stage displays the results to the user. This includes: - The total number of words. - A sorted list of words with their frequencies.

Below are the details of the specific versions and features utilized in CountYourWords. Java Version CountYourWords is built on Java version 11 (JDK 11). This version was chosen for its balance between performance, security, and feature set, making it suitable for both development and production environments. java // Example of setting the Java version in a build tool like Maven <properties> <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source> <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target> </properties> Key Libraries and Dependencies Hamcrest Core (Version 1.3) Hamcrest is used for writing readable assertions in tests. It provides a more expressive way to write test cases compared to traditional JUnit assertions. ```java // Example of using Hamcrest in a test case import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo; @Test public void testSingleLine() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertThat(result.getFirst(), equalTo(2)); } ``` JUnit 4 (Version 4.13.2) JUnit is the de-facto standard for writing repeatable tests in Java. It provides a simple and flexible framework to create and run tests. ```java // Example of a JUnit test class import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals; public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList assertEquals(0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty()); } } ``` Programming Language Features Utilized Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) CountYourWords is designed using OOP principles. It includes classes such as CountYourWords, Sort, and Pair to encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability. ```java // Example of a simple class in CountYourWords public class CountYourWords { public static Pair count(ArrayList public static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) { // Implementation details } } ``` Generics Generics are used extensively to ensure type safety and reduce the need for casting. ```java // Example of using generics in CountYourWords public class Pair public Pair(T first, R second) { this.first = first; this.second = second; } // Getters and setters } ```",

The process involves reading the file path provided by the user, validating it, and then preparing the text data for word counting. Receiving User Input The user input is handled in the App.java class within the main method: ```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); System.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \"); // Reading File name String path = \"\"; try { path = br.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } } ``` This code snippet reads a file path from the user and stores it in the path variable. The BufferedReader is used to handle input from the standard input stream. Validating User Input The validation of the user-provided file path is implicitly handled by the subsequent method calls that attempt to read the file: java ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path); If the file does not exist or cannot be accessed, a FileNotFoundException will be thrown. This exception handling ensures that only valid file paths are processed. Preparing Input for Word Counting Once the file is successfully read, the lines of text are passed to the count method in the CountYourWords.java class: java Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); The count method processes each line of text, counting the occurrences of each word. It uses a HashMap<String, Integer> to store the word counts. Data Structures Used The primary data structure used in this section is the HashMap<String, Integer>. This map stores words as keys and their respective counts as values. The Pair class is also used to encapsulate two pieces of related information: the total number of words and the word count map: ```java public final class Pair { private final int totalCount; private final HashMap public Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) { this.totalCount = first; this.wordCounts = second; } public int getFirst() { return totalCount; } public HashMap<String, Integer> getSecond() { return wordCounts; } } ``` The Pair class provides a convenient way to return two values from the count method.",

This pipeline consists of several stages, each with a specific role in processing the data. Below, we will outline each stage and detail any intermediate data transformations or calculations. 1. Reading Input File The first step in the pipeline is reading the input file. The App class prompts the user to enter a file path and reads the contents of the specified file using the readFile method from the CountYourWords class. java public static ArrayList<String> readFile(String path) throws FileNotFoundException { ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>(); try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) { String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { lines.add(line); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } return lines; } Source: App.java, PK: ac863f346e618f9a959b5c95d5d28941 2. Counting Words The next stage is counting the words in the input file. The count method from the CountYourWords class processes each line, splits it into words, and counts their occurrences. ```java public static Pair count(ArrayList for (String line : lines) { String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty() && !Character.isDigit(word.charAt(0))) { word = word.toLowerCase(); wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); totalWords++; } } } return new Pair(totalWords, wordCount); } ``` Source: CountYourWords.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here] 3. Sorting Words After counting the words, the next step is sorting them by frequency. The sort method from the Sort class implements a custom sorting algorithm to sort the word counts. ```java public static ArrayList ArrayList<String> sortedList = new ArrayList<>(); for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) { sortedList.add(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue()); } return sortedList; } ``` Source: Sort.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here] 4. Outputting Results Finally, the processed data is outputted to the console. The main method in the App class prints the total number of words and each word's count. ```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); System.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \"); String path = \"\"; try { path = br.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } ArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(path); Pair wordTotalCount = count(fileLines); ArrayList<String> finaList = sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond()); System.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst()); for (String line : finaList) { System.out.println(line); } } ``` Source: App.java, PK: ac863f346e618f9a959b5c95d5d28941",

The primary goal is to ensure that the output is clear, consistent, and easy to understand. Output Structure The result of a word count operation is typically structured as a Pair object, where the first element represents the total number of words and the second element is a HashMap containing the frequency of each word. This structure allows for both a summary statistic and detailed breakdown of the word distribution. ```java public class Pair { private int first; private HashMap public Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) { this.first = first; this.second = second; } // Getters and setters } ``` Formatting Rules Total Word Count: The total word count is displayed at the top of the output. Word Frequency Table: A table is generated to show each unique word along with its frequency. Example Output Given a file with the following content: Hello world This is a test. World of Java! The output might look like this: ```plaintext Total Words: 9 Word Frequency hello 1 world 2 this 1 is 1 a 1 test 1 of 1 java 1 ``` Code Implementation The CountYourWords class contains the logic to perform the word count and format the output. Below is an example implementation: ```java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair count(ArrayList for (String line : fileLines) { String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\"); totalWords += words.length; for (String word : words) { word = word.toLowerCase().replaceAll(\"[^a-z0-9]\", \"\"); if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } } return new Pair(totalWords, wordCounts); } } ``` Testing To ensure the formatting is correct, unit tests are provided. Below is an example test case: ```java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testMultipleLines() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(9, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2); expectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } } ```",

This means that words like \"word\" and \"Word\" are counted as the same word, resulting in a total count of 1 for both occurrences.\n\nImplementation Details\n\nTo achieve this, the algorithm uses a HashMap<String, Integer> to store word counts. When processing each line of text, it splits the line into individual words using whitespace as the delimiter. Each word is then converted to lowercase before being added to the map. This ensures that all variations of the same word (e.g., \"apple\", \"Apple\", \"APPLE\") are counted together.\n\nHere is a simplified example of how this might be implemented in Java:\n\n```java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair\n\n    for (String line : fileLines) {\n        String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        for (String word : words) {\n            // Convert word to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity\n            String lowerCaseWord = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCounts.put(lowerCaseWord, wordCounts.getOrDefault(lowerCaseWord, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return new Pair<>(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTesting Case Sensitivity\n\nTo verify that the case-insensitivity handling works as expected, a test method named testCaseInsensitivity is provided in the CountYourWordsTest class. This test adds a line with multiple occurrences of \"apple\" (in different cases) to an ArrayList. It then calls the count() method and asserts that the total word count is 4 and that the word counts are case-insensitive.\n\n```java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList\n\n    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\n    assertEquals(4, result.getFirst());\n\n    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\n    expectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4);\n\n    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nTo better visualize the flow of data through the count() method, a simple Mermaid diagram can be used:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[Input: ArrayList<String> fileLines] --> B{Split line into words}; B -- Word is \"apple\" --> C{Convert to lowercase}; C -- Lowercase word is \"apple\" --> D[Update word count in HashMap]; D --> E[Repeat for all words and lines]; E --> F[Return Pair with total word count and word counts map];\n\nThis diagram shows the key steps involved in counting words, including splitting lines into words, converting them to lowercase, updating the word count map, and returning the results.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords algorithm handles case sensitivity by treating all variations of a word as the same. This is achieved through the use of a HashMap<String, Integer> where each word is converted to lowercase before being added or updated in the map. The provided test method ensures that this functionality works correctly, and a Mermaid diagram helps visualize the flow of data through the algorithm.",

This ensures that all variations of the same word (e.g., \"apple\", \"Apple\", \"APPLE\") are counted together.\n\nHere is a simplified example of how this might be implemented in Java:\n\n```java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair\n\n    for (String line : fileLines) {\n        String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n        for (String word : words) {\n            // Convert word to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity\n            String lowerCaseWord = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCounts.put(lowerCaseWord, wordCounts.getOrDefault(lowerCaseWord, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return new Pair<>(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTesting Case Sensitivity\n\nTo verify that the case-insensitivity handling works as expected, a test method named testCaseInsensitivity is provided in the CountYourWordsTest class. This test adds a line with multiple occurrences of \"apple\" (in different cases) to an ArrayList. It then calls the count() method and asserts that the total word count is 4 and that the word counts are case-insensitive.\n\n```java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList\n\n    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\n    assertEquals(4, result.getFirst());\n\n    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\n    expectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4);\n\n    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nTo better visualize the flow of data through the count() method, a simple Mermaid diagram can be used:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[Input: ArrayList<String> fileLines] --> B{Split line into words}; B -- Word is \"apple\" --> C{Convert to lowercase}; C -- Lowercase word is \"apple\" --> D[Update word count in HashMap]; D --> E[Repeat for all words and lines]; E --> F[Return Pair with total word count and word counts map];\n\nThis diagram shows the key steps involved in counting words, including splitting lines into words, converting them to lowercase, updating the word count map, and returning the results.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords algorithm handles case sensitivity by treating all variations of a word as the same. This is achieved through the use of a HashMap<String, Integer> where each word is converted to lowercase before being added or updated in the map. The provided test method ensures that this functionality works correctly, and a Mermaid diagram helps visualize the flow of data through the algorithm.",

This section delves into the features related to analyzing text, such as frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.\n\nFrequency Analysis\n\nFrequency analysis is a fundamental technique used to determine how often each word appears in a given text. CountYourWords uses this feature to provide insights into the distribution of words within a document. The following code snippet demonstrates how frequency analysis can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class FrequencyAnalyzer { public static Map\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return wordCount;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\";\n    Map<String, Integer> frequencyMap = analyzeFrequency(text);\n    System.out.println(frequencyMap);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nSentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. CountYourWords utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis. The following code snippet illustrates how sentiment analysis can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class SentimentAnalyzer { private static final Map\n\nstatic {\n    sentimentScores.put(\"happy\", 1);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"sad\", -1);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"angry\", -2);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"excited\", 2);\n}\n\npublic static int analyzeSentiment(String text) {\n    String[] words = text.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\");\n    int sentimentScore = 0;\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (sentimentScores.containsKey(word)) {\n            sentimentScore += sentimentScores.get(word);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return sentimentScore;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"I am very happy today. The weather is beautiful.\";\n    int sentiment = analyzeSentiment(text);\n    System.out.println(\"Sentiment Score: \" + sentiment);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nKeyword Extraction\n\nKeyword extraction involves identifying the most important words or phrases in a piece of text. CountYourWords uses techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract keywords. The following code snippet demonstrates how keyword extraction can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class KeywordExtractor { public static Map\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    double totalWords = wordCount.size();\n    Map<String, Double> keywordScores = new HashMap<>();\n\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) {\n        String word = entry.getKey();\n        int count = entry.getValue();\n        double score = (count / totalWords) * Math.log(totalWords / 1.0); // Simplified TF-IDF\n        keywordScores.put(word, score);\n    }\n\n    return keywordScores;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\";\n    Map<String, Double> keywords = extractKeywords(text);\n    System.out.println(keywords);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTools and Libraries\n\nCountYourWords leverages several tools and libraries to enhance its text analysis capabilities:\n\nJava Collections Framework: Used for data structures like HashMap to store word counts.\n\nJUnit: For unit testing the text analysis features, ensuring they work as expected.\n\nHamcrest Core: Provides matchers for assertions in JUnit tests.\n\nThese tools and libraries help ensure that CountYourWords is both efficient and reliable in its text analysis tasks.",

CountYourWords uses techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract keywords. The following code snippet demonstrates how keyword extraction can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class KeywordExtractor { public static Map\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    double totalWords = wordCount.size();\n    Map<String, Double> keywordScores = new HashMap<>();\n\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) {\n        String word = entry.getKey();\n        int count = entry.getValue();\n        double score = (count / totalWords) * Math.log(totalWords / 1.0); // Simplified TF-IDF\n        keywordScores.put(word, score);\n    }\n\n    return keywordScores;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\";\n    Map<String, Double> keywords = extractKeywords(text);\n    System.out.println(keywords);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTools and Libraries\n\nCountYourWords leverages several tools and libraries to enhance its text analysis capabilities:\n\nJava Collections Framework: Used for data structures like HashMap to store word counts.\n\nJUnit: For unit testing the text analysis features, ensuring they work as expected.\n\nHamcrest Core: Provides matchers for assertions in JUnit tests.\n\nThese tools and libraries help ensure that CountYourWords is both efficient and reliable in its text analysis tasks.",

This section delves into the features related to analyzing text, such as frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction. Frequency Analysis Frequency analysis is a fundamental technique used to determine how often each word appears in a given text. CountYourWords uses this feature to provide insights into the distribution of words within a document. The following code snippet demonstrates how frequency analysis can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class FrequencyAnalyzer { public static Map for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } return wordCount; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\"; Map<String, Integer> frequencyMap = analyzeFrequency(text); System.out.println(frequencyMap); } } ``` Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. CountYourWords utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis. The following code snippet illustrates how sentiment analysis can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class SentimentAnalyzer { private static final Map static { sentimentScores.put(\"happy\", 1); sentimentScores.put(\"sad\", -1); sentimentScores.put(\"angry\", -2); sentimentScores.put(\"excited\", 2); } public static int analyzeSentiment(String text) { String[] words = text.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\"); int sentimentScore = 0; for (String word : words) { if (sentimentScores.containsKey(word)) { sentimentScore += sentimentScores.get(word); } } return sentimentScore; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"I am very happy today.

This ensures that the output is not only accurate but also easy to interpret, with words presented in ascending order based on their frequency.\n\nOverview of the Sorting Algorithm\n\nThe primary sorting algorithm used in CountYourWords is an insertion sort. This method is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency for smaller datasets, which is typical for word count results. The insertion sort algorithm works by iterating through the list, comparing each element with the ones before it, and inserting it into the correct position.\n\nImplementation Details\n\nThe sorting logic is encapsulated in the CountYourWords.sort method, located in the CountYourWords.java file. Below is a detailed breakdown of this method:\n\n```java public static ArrayList\n\n// Now to add the values back\nfor (String word : sortedWords) {\n    String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word));\n    String fString = word + \" \" + value;\n    sortedWordCounts.add(fString);\n}\n\nreturn sortedWordCounts;\n\n} ```\n\nKey Points: - Input: The method takes a HashMap<String, Integer> where keys are words and values are their counts. - Output: It returns an ArrayList<String> containing strings of sorted words with their counts. - Sorting Logic: Words are first extracted from the HashMap and sorted using the Sort.insertionSort method. Each word is then combined with its count to form a string, which is added to the result list.\n\nTesting the Sorting Mechanism\n\nTo ensure the sorting mechanism works as expected, comprehensive tests are provided in the CountYourWordsTest.java file. Below are some key test cases:\n\n```java @Test public void sortSingleTest() { HashMap\n\n@Test public void sortMultipleTest() { HashMap\n\nList<String> expectedKeys = Arrays.asList(\"apple 1\", \"banana 1\", \"cherry 1\");\nList<String> actualKeys = sortedArray;\n\nassertEquals(\"Keys should be sorted\", expectedKeys, actualKeys);\n\n} ```\n\nKey Points: - sortSingleTest: Tests sorting with a single word. - sortMultipleTest: Tests sorting with multiple words and verifies the order.\n\nComplexity Analysis\n\nThe insertion sort algorithm used in CountYourWords has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to its nested loops. This is suitable for smaller datasets, which is typical for word count results. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted words and their counts.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe sorting mechanism in CountYourWords is designed to organize word count results efficiently using an insertion sort algorithm. This ensures that the output is presented in ascending order based on word frequency, making it easy to interpret and analyze. The provided tests cover various scenarios to ensure the correctness of the sorting logic.",

These tools enhance various aspects of the application, from testing and assertions to sorting algorithms.\n\nHamcrest Core (hamcrest-core-1.3.jar)\n\nPurpose: Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects in Java. It provides a more readable way to assert conditions in tests compared to traditional JUnit assertions.\n\nRole: This library is used extensively for creating custom matchers in the test suite, making it easier to write expressive and maintainable test cases.\n\nJUnit (junit-4.13.2.jar)\n\nPurpose: JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java applications. It allows developers to write repeatable tests that validate their code.\n\nRole: The CountYourWords project uses JUnit to create unit tests for its core functionality, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under various conditions.\n\nCustom Libraries and Classes\n\nIn addition to external libraries, the CountYourWords project includes several custom classes and utilities:\n\nPair Class (src/main/Pair.java)\n\nPurpose: The Pair class is a simple utility class used to store two related objects together. It is particularly useful in sorting algorithms where pairs of words and their counts need to be maintained.\n\nRole: This class simplifies the handling of word-count pairs, making the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nSort Class (src/main/Sort.java)\n\nPurpose: The Sort class contains various sorting algorithms. Currently, it includes an insertion sort implementation, which is used to sort words alphabetically before counting their occurrences.\n\nRole: This class encapsulates the logic for sorting operations, ensuring that the main application logic remains clean and focused on word processing.\n\nExample Code Snippets\n\nBelow are some example code snippets demonstrating the use of these frameworks and libraries:\n\nHamcrest Matcher Example (src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java)\n\n```java import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { // Arrange String input = \"hello world hello\"; CountYourWords countYourWords = new CountYourWords();\n\n    // Act\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = countYourWords.countWords(input);\n\n    // Assert\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"hello\"), equalTo(2));\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"world\"), equalTo(1));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nJUnit Test Example (src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java)\n\n```java import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { // Arrange String input = \"hello world hello\"; CountYourWords countYourWords = new CountYourWords();\n\n    // Act\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = countYourWords.countWords(input);\n\n    // Assert\n    assertEquals(2, (int) wordCounts.get(\"hello\"));\n    assertEquals(1, (int) wordCounts.get(\"world\"));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSort Algorithm Example (src/main/Sort.java)\n\n```java import java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    ArrayList<String> sortedList = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (String s : array) {\n        sortedList.add(s);\n    }\n    return sortedList;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships between the main components of the CountYourWords project:\n\nmermaid graph TD A[CountYourWords.java] --> B[Sort.java] A --> C[Pair.java] B --> D[junit-4.13.2.jar] C --> E[hamcrest-core-1.3.jar]\n\nThis diagram shows how the main application class depends on sorting and utility classes, which in turn depend on testing and assertion libraries.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project leverages several frameworks and libraries to enhance its development process. Hamcrest and JUnit provide robust testing capabilities, while custom classes like Pair and Sort encapsulate specific functionality. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for anyone working on or maintaining the CountYourWords project.",

          "page_content": "Frameworks and Libraries Frameworks and Libraries The CountYourWords project relies on several frameworks and libraries to facilitate its development. These tools enhance various aspects of the application, from testing and assertions to sorting algorithms. Hamcrest Core (hamcrest-core-1.3.jar) Purpose: Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects in Java. It provides a more readable way to assert conditions in tests compared to traditional JUnit assertions. Role: This library is used extensively for creating custom matchers in the test suite, making it easier to write expressive and maintainable test cases. JUnit (junit-4.13.2.jar) Purpose: JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java applications. It allows developers to write repeatable tests that validate their code. Role: The CountYourWords project uses JUnit to create unit tests for its core functionality, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under various conditions. Custom Libraries and Classes In addition to external libraries, the CountYourWords project includes several custom classes and utilities: Pair Class (src/main/Pair.java) Purpose: The Pair class is a simple utility class used to store two related objects together. It is particularly useful in sorting algorithms where pairs of words and their counts need to be maintained.

The primary components of the user interface include:\n\nConsole Input/Output\n\nThe application reads input from a fixed file named input.txt located in the project directory. The output is displayed directly in the console, showing the total number of words and their occurrences.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Main class to read input and display results public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) { HashMap\n\nprivate static void processLine(String line, HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\");\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            word = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nFile Handling\n\nThe application handles file reading and writing operations. It reads from input.txt and writes the results to the console.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Utility class for file handling public class FileUtils { public static String readFile(String filePath) throws IOException { StringBuilder content = new StringBuilder(); try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { content.append(line).append(\"\\n\"); } } return content.toString(); }\n\npublic static void writeFile(String filePath, String content) throws IOException {\n    try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath))) {\n        writer.write(content);\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSorting Algorithm\n\nThe application includes a custom sorting algorithm to sort the words alphabetically. This algorithm is implemented in the Sort class.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Custom sorting algorithm public class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    // Now to add the values back\n    for (String word : sortedWords) {\n        String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word));\n        String fString = word + \" \" + value;\n        sortedWordCounts.add(fString);\n    }\n\n    return sortedWordCounts;\n}\n\nprivate static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) {\n    ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array));\n    for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) {\n        String key = list.get(i);\n        int j = i - 1;\n        while (j >= 0 && list.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) {\n            list.set(j + 1, list.get(j));\n            j--;\n        }\n        list.set(j + 1, key);\n    }\n    return list;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nError Handling\n\nThe application includes basic error handling to manage file reading and processing errors.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Main class with error handling public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) { HashMap\n\nprivate static void processLine(String line, HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\");\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            word = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSummary\n\nThe user interface of CountYourWords is designed to be simple and straightforward. It reads input from a fixed file, processes the text using custom logic, sorts the results alphabetically, and outputs them directly to the console.

          "page_content": "User Interface Features User Interface Features CountYourWords provides a simple and intuitive user interface that allows users to interact with the text parsing functionality. The primary components of the user interface include: Console Input/Output The application reads input from a fixed file named input.txt located in the project directory. The output is displayed directly in the console, showing the total number of words and their occurrences. Code Example: ```java // Main class to read input and display results public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) { HashMap private static void processLine(String line, HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) { String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { word = word.toLowerCase(); wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } } } ``` File Handling The application handles file reading and writing operations. It reads from input.txt and writes the results to the console. Code Example: ```java // Utility class for file handling public class FileUtils { public static String readFile(String filePath) throws IOException { StringBuilder content = new StringBuilder(); try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { content.append(line).append(\"\\n\"); } } return content.toString(); } public static void writeFile(String filePath, String content) throws IOException { try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath))) { writer.write(content); } } } ``` Sorting Algorithm The application includes a custom sorting algorithm to sort the words alphabetically. This algorithm is implemented in the Sort class. Code Example: ```java // Custom sorting algorithm public class Sort { public static ArrayList // Now to add the values back for (String word : sortedWords) { String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word)); String fString = word + \" \" + value; sortedWordCounts.add(fString); } return sortedWordCounts; } private static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) { ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array)); for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) { String key = list.get(i); int j = i - 1; while (j >= 0 && list.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) { list.set(j + 1, list.get(j)); j--; } list.set(j + 1, key); } return list; } } ```",

This process involves several key steps, including sorting and filtering the word counts before final presentation.\n\nSorting Word Counts\n\nWord counts are sorted based on their frequency in descending order. The sorting logic is implemented in the Sort.java file. Below is a code snippet demonstrating the sorting method:\n\n```java public class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    // Sort the list based on value (frequency)\n    Collections.sort(list, new Comparator<Map.Entry<String, Integer>>() {\n        public int compare(Map.Entry<String, Integer> o1, Map.Entry<String, Integer> o2) {\n            return (o2.getValue()).compareTo(o1.getValue());\n        }\n    });\n\n    // Convert sorted list back to ArrayList of strings\n    ArrayList<String> sortedList = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) {\n        sortedList.add(entry.getKey() + \" \" + entry.getValue());\n    }\n\n    return sortedList;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: 1. Conversion to List: The HashMap of word counts is converted into a List of entries. 2. Sorting: The list is sorted using Collections.sort() with a custom comparator that compares the values (frequencies) in descending order. 3. Conversion Back to ArrayList: The sorted list is then converted back into an ArrayList<String> where each element represents a word and its count.\n\nFiltering Word Counts\n\nFiltering is not explicitly implemented in the current version of CountYourWords, but it could be added if needed. For example, one might want to filter out words that appear less than a certain number of times or exclude common stop words.\n\nPresentation of Results\n\nThe final step in output generation is presenting the sorted word counts to the user. This is handled by the main method in the App.java file:\n\n```java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\n    System.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \");\n\n    // Reading File name\n    String path = \"\";\n    try {\n        path = br.readLine();\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n\n    ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);\n    Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n    ArrayList<String> finaList = Sort.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond());\n    System.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst());\n    for (String line : finaList) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: 1. User Input: The user is prompted to enter the file path. 2. File Reading and Counting: The readFile method reads the file, and the count method counts the words. 3. Sorting: The word counts are sorted using the Sort.sort() method. 4. Output: The total number of words and the sorted list are printed to the console.\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data through the output generation process:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[User Input] --> B[Read File]; B --> C[Count Words]; C --> D[Sort Word Counts]; D --> E[Output Results];\n\nExplanation: 1. User Input: The user provides a file path. 2. Read File: The file is read and its contents are stored in an ArrayList. 3. Count Words: The word counts are calculated using the count method. 4. Sort Word Counts: The word counts are sorted based on frequency. 5. Output Results: The total number of words and the sorted list are displayed to the user.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the word count results are presented in a clear, organized manner, making it easy for users to understand the distribution of words in their text files.",

          "page_content": "Word Counting Algorithm\n\nWord Counting Algorithm\n\nThe CountYourWords project includes a robust word counting algorithm that processes input text to count occurrences of each word. This algorithm is crucial for various applications such as text analysis, SEO optimization, and natural language processing.\n\nTokenization\n\nTokenization is the process of breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords algorithm uses a simple yet effective tokenization method:\n\njava public static ArrayList<String> tokenize(String text) { return new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\s+\"))); }\n\nThis method splits the input text using whitespace as the delimiter and returns an ArrayList of tokens.\n\nCase Sensitivity Handling\n\nThe algorithm handles case sensitivity by converting all words to lowercase before counting. This ensures that words like \"Hello\" and \"hello\" are counted as the same word:\n\njava public static HashMap<String, Integer> countWords(ArrayList<String> tokens) { HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String token : tokens) { String lowerCaseToken = token.toLowerCase(); wordCounts.put(lowerCaseToken, wordCounts.getOrDefault(lowerCaseToken, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; }\n\nPunctuation Rules\n\nThe algorithm ignores punctuation when counting words. For example, \"hello,\" and \"hello\" are considered the same word:\n\njava public static ArrayList<String> cleanTokens(ArrayList<String> tokens) { ArrayList<String> cleanedTokens = new ArrayList<>(); for (String token : tokens) { if (!token.matches(\"[^a-zA-Z0-9]+\")) { cleanedTokens.add(token.toLowerCase()); } } return cleanedTokens; }\n\nThis method filters out any tokens that contain non-alphanumeric characters, ensuring that only words are counted.\n\nPutting It All Together\n\nThe CountYourWords algorithm combines these steps to count the occurrences of each word in a given text:\n\njava public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { ArrayList<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>(); for (String line : fileLines) { tokens.addAll(cleanTokens(tokenize(line))); } int totalWords = tokens.size(); HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = countWords(tokens); return new Pair<>(totalWords, wordCounts); }\n\nThis method processes each line of the input text, cleans and tokenizes it, counts the words, and returns a Pair containing the total number of words and a map of word frequencies.\n\nExample Usage\n\nTo use the CountYourWords algorithm, you can call the count method with an ArrayList of file lines:\n\n```java public static void main(String[] args) { ArrayList\n\nPair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nSystem.out.println(\"Total words: \" + result.getFirst());\nSystem.out.println(\"Word counts: \" + result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nThis example demonstrates how to count the occurrences of each word in a list of file lines and print the results.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project's word counting algorithm is designed to be efficient, accurate, and easy to understand. By handling tokenization, case sensitivity, and punctuation rules, this algorithm provides valuable insights into text data, making it an essential component for various applications in natural language processing and text analysis.",

          "page_content": "Filtering Criteria\n\nFiltering Criteria\n\nThe CountYourWords project includes several filtering rules applied to the word count data before it is presented to the user. These filters ensure that the output is accurate and meaningful, adhering to specific requirements and constraints.\n\nCase Insensitivity\n\nOne of the primary filtering criteria is case insensitivity. The system ensures that words are counted without considering their case (e.g., \"apple\" and \"Apple\" are considered the same word). This is crucial for providing a more comprehensive word count analysis.\n\nExample Usage: ```java @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(4, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: In the example above, the testCaseInsensitivity method tests the case insensitivity of word counting. It adds a line with multiple occurrences of \"apple\" (in different cases) to an ArrayList. The CountYourWords.count() method is then called with this list, and it returns a Pair containing the total word count and the word counts map.\n\nThe test asserts that the total word count is 4 and that the word counts are case-insensitive. This ensures that all occurrences of \"apple\" are counted as one.\n\nEmpty File Handling\n\nAnother important filtering rule is handling empty files. If a file is empty, the system should return a total word count of 0 and an empty map for word counts.\n\nExample Usage: ```java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\nassertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: The testEmptyFile method tests the handling of empty files. It creates an empty ArrayList and calls the CountYourWords.count() method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 0 and that the word counts map is empty.\n\nThis ensures that the system correctly handles cases where no words are present in the file, providing a consistent and meaningful output.\n\nSingle Line Handling\n\nThe system also includes filtering rules for handling files with a single line. It should accurately count the words in the single line and return the correct word counts.\n\nExample Usage: ```java @Test public void testSingleLine() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(2, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: The testSingleLine method tests the handling of files with a single line. It creates an ArrayList containing a single line and calls the CountYourWords.count() method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 2 and that the word counts match the expected values.\n\nThis ensures that the system correctly handles cases where words are present in a single line, providing accurate and meaningful output.\n\nMultiple Lines Handling\n\nFinally, the system includes filtering rules for handling files with multiple lines. It should accurately count the words across all lines and return the correct word counts.\n\nExample Usage: ```java @Test public void testMultipleLines() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(9, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nExplanation: The testMultipleLines method tests the handling of files with multiple lines. It creates an ArrayList containing multiple lines and calls the CountYourWords.count() method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 9 and that the word counts match the expected values.\n\nThis ensures that the system correctly handles cases where words are present across multiple lines, providing accurate and meaningful output.\n\nSummary\n\nThe filtering criteria in the CountYourWords project ensure that the word count data is processed accurately and meaningfully. The case insensitivity rule ensures that words are counted without considering their case, while the handling of empty files, single lines, and multiple lines ensures that the system correctly processes different types of input.\n\nThese filters contribute to a more comprehensive and reliable word count analysis, providing valuable insights into the content of text files.",

          "page_content": "Filtering Criteria Filtering Criteria The CountYourWords project includes several filtering rules applied to the word count data before it is presented to the user. These filters ensure that the output is accurate and meaningful, adhering to specific requirements and constraints. Case Insensitivity One of the primary filtering criteria is case insensitivity. The system ensures that words are counted without considering their case (e.g., \"apple\" and \"Apple\" are considered the same word). This is crucial for providing a more comprehensive word count analysis. Example Usage: ```java @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(4, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } ``` Explanation: In the example above, the testCaseInsensitivity method tests the case insensitivity of word counting. It adds a line with multiple occurrences of \"apple\" (in different cases) to an ArrayList. The CountYourWords.count() method is then called with this list, and it returns a Pair containing the total word count and the word counts map. The test asserts that the total word count is 4 and that the word counts are case-insensitive. This ensures that all occurrences of \"apple\" are counted as one. Empty File Handling Another important filtering rule is handling empty files. If a file is empty, the system should return a total word count of 0 and an empty map for word counts. Example Usage: ```java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty()); } ``` Explanation: The testEmptyFile method tests the handling of empty files. It creates an empty ArrayList and calls the CountYourWords.count() method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 0 and that the word counts map is empty. This ensures that the system correctly handles cases where no words are present in the file, providing a consistent and meaningful output.",

In a production environment, you would want to handle this exception more gracefully, possibly by prompting the user again or providing an error message.\n\nStoring Input Data\n\nThe input data, which in this case is the contents of a text file, is stored in an ArrayList<String>:\n\njava ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);\n\nThis list holds each line of the file as a separate element. The readFile method reads the file and populates this list.\n\nData Structures\n\nThe primary data structure used for storing input data in CountYourWords is an ArrayList<String>. This allows for efficient addition, removal, and access of elements by index. Additionally, the application uses other data structures such as HashMap<String, Integer> to count word occurrences and Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> to store both the total word count and the word counts.\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nHere is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data through the input handling process:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[User Input] --> B{Validation}; B -- Valid --> C[Read File]; C --> D[Store in ArrayList<String>]; D --> E[Count Words]; E --> F[Sort Words]; F --> G[Display Results];\n\nConclusion\n\nThe input handling process in CountYourWords is a critical part of the application's architecture.

This allows for efficient addition, removal, and access of elements by index. Additionally, the application uses other data structures such as HashMap<String, Integer> to count word occurrences and Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> to store both the total word count and the word counts. Mermaid Diagram Here is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data through the input handling process: mermaid graph TD; A[User Input] --> B{Validation}; B -- Valid --> C[Read File]; C --> D[Store in ArrayList<String>]; D --> E[Count Words]; E --> F[Sort Words]; F --> G[Display Results]; Conclusion The input handling process in CountYourWords is a critical part of the application's architecture. It involves receiving user input, validating it, and storing it in appropriate data structures before further processing. By understanding this process, developers can better appreciate how user inputs are managed within the application and ensure that the system handles various scenarios gracefully.",

The architecture of the system is modular, with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to understand and maintain. Major Components Input Handling File Reading: The application reads from a fixed file named input.txt. Source Code: Located in src/main/App.java java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { // Read input file and process text } } Text Processing Word Counting: The core functionality of counting words and their occurrences. Source Code: Located in src/main/CountYourWords.java java public class CountYourWords { public static HashMap<String, Integer> countWords(String text) { // Logic to count words return new HashMap<>(); } } Sorting Custom Sorting: The application uses a custom sorting algorithm to sort the word counts alphabetically. Source Code: Located in src/main/Sort.java java public class Sort { public static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) { // Insertion sort logic return new ArrayList<>(); } } Output Printing Results: The application prints the word counts and their occurrences. Source Code: Located in src/main/App.java java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { // Read input file, process text, and print results } } Testing Unit Tests: The application includes unit tests to ensure the correctness of each component. Source Code: Located in src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testCountWords() { // Test logic for countWords method } } Component Interactions The components interact as follows: App.java reads the input file and processes the text using CountYourWords.java. **CountYourWords.javacounts words and their occurrences, which are then sorted bySort.java`. **App.java` prints the sorted word counts.

This includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. The following sections detail the setup and tools used in each type of test.\n\nUnit Tests\n\nUnit tests focus on individual methods or functions within the codebase. For CountYourWords, these tests are located in the CountYourWordsTest.java file. The primary testing framework used is JUnit 4.13.2, which provides a robust set of annotations and utilities for writing and running tests.\n\nExample Unit Test\n\nHere is an example unit test from CountYourWordsTest.java:\n\njava @Test public void sortEmptyTest() { HashMap<String, Integer> emptyMap = new HashMap<>(); ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(emptyMap); assertTrue(\"Array should be empty\", sortedArray.isEmpty()); }\n\nThis test checks that the sort method correctly handles an empty map of word counts.\n\nIntegration Tests\n\nIntegration tests verify that different components of the application work together as expected. For CountYourWords, these tests are also located in the CountYourWordsTest.java file. The focus is on testing the interaction between methods and classes.\n\nExample Integration Test\n\nHere is an example integration test from CountYourWordsTest.java:\n\n```java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\nassertEquals(\"Total words should be 0\", 0, result.getFirst());\nassertTrue(\"Word counts map should be empty\", result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n\n} ```\n\nThis test checks that the count method correctly processes an empty file.\n\nEnd-to-End Tests\n\nEnd-to-end tests simulate real-world usage of the application. For CountYourWords, these tests are located in the textTests directory and involve reading files and counting words.\n\nExample End-to-End Test\n\nThe textTests directory contains several test files (emptyFile.txt, exampleFile.txt, etc.) that are used to simulate different scenarios. Here is an example of how one might write a simple script to run these tests:\n\nbash java -cp .:lib/junit-4.13.2.jar:lib/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar CountYourWordsTest\n\nThis command runs the CountYourWordsTest class using JUnit, which will execute all the tests defined within it.\n\nTesting Environment Setup\n\nThe testing environment is set up to use the following tools and libraries:\n\nJUnit 4.13.2: The primary testing framework.\n\nHamcrest Core 1.3: A library for writing matcher objects in Java.\n\nTest Files: Located in the textTests directory, these files are used to simulate different input scenarios.\n\nDiagrams\n\nBelow is a Mermaid diagram that illustrates the relationships between the test classes and methods:\n\nmermaid graph TD; CountYourWordsTest -->|sortEmptyTest| sortMethod CountYourWordsTest -->|sortSingleTest| sortMethod CountYourWordsTest -->|sortMultipleTest| sortMethod CountYourWordsTest -->|testEmptyFile| countMethod CountYourWordsTest -->|testSingleLine| countMethod CountYourWordsTest -->|testMultipleLines| countMethod\n\nThis diagram shows how the CountYourWordsTest class interacts with the sort and count methods.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe testing environment for CountYourWords is comprehensive, covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. By using JUnit 4.13.2 and Hamcrest Core 1.3, developers can ensure that all components of the application are thoroughly tested. The use of test files in the textTests directory allows for realistic simulation of user input scenarios.",

Processing Module Purpose: Counts word occurrences and aggregates results. Components: Pair.java: Immutable class representing a pair of values (total count and word counts). Sort.java: Utility class for sorting word counts. Output Handling Module Purpose: Formats and outputs the results. Components: Not explicitly detailed in the provided context, but typically would include classes or methods to format and display the word count results.

          "page_content": "Integration Points\n\nIntegration Points\n\nIn this section, we will identify and describe any integration points between different components or external systems within the CountYourWords project. These integration points are crucial for understanding how various parts of the system interact with each other and with external resources.\n\nInternal Component Integration\n\nThe primary internal component in CountYourWords is the CountYourWords class, which handles the main logic for counting words in a text file. This class interacts with several other components:\n\nPair Class: The Pair class is used to store and return results from word count operations.

The specific test coverage targets are outlined below:\n\n1. Code Coverage Target\n\nOur primary goal is to achieve a minimum code coverage of 90% across all source files. This target ensures that the majority of the application's functionality is tested, reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving overall software quality.\n\nExample:\n\njava // CountYourWords.java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { // Implementation details... } }\n\n2. Unit Test Coverage Target\n\nFor each unit (method or function), we aim to achieve a minimum of 80% coverage. This ensures that individual components are thoroughly tested and behave as expected.\n\nExample:\n\n```java // CountYourWordsTest.java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\n    assertEquals(\"Total words should be 0\", 0, result.getFirst());\n    assertTrue(\"Word counts map should be empty\", result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n}\n\n} ```\n\n3. Integration Test Coverage Target\n\nIntegration tests are crucial for ensuring that different components of the application work together seamlessly. We aim to achieve a minimum of 70% coverage in integration tests.\n\nExample:\n\n```java // SortTest.java public class SortTest { @Test public void sortMultipleTest() { HashMap\n\n    List<String> expectedKeys = Arrays.asList(\"apple 1\", \"banana 1\", \"cherry 1\");\n    List<String> actualKeys = sortedArray;\n\n    assertEquals(\"Keys should be sorted\", expectedKeys, actualKeys);\n}\n\n} ```\n\n4. Test Coverage Metrics\n\nTo measure and track our progress towards these goals, we use several metrics:\n\nLine Coverage: The percentage of lines executed during tests.\n\nBranch Coverage: The percentage of branches (e.g., if statements) that are tested.\n\nMethod Coverage: The percentage of methods that have at least one test case.\n\n5. Test Coverage Tools\n\nWe utilize tools like JaCoCo and SonarQube to automatically measure and report on our test coverage. These tools help us identify untested code and ensure continuous improvement in our testing strategy.\n\nExample JaCoCo Configuration:\n\nxml <plugin> <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId> <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId> <version>0.8.7</version> <executions> <execution> <goals> <goal>prepare-agent</goal> </goals> </execution> <execution> <id>report</id> <phase>test</phase> <goals> <goal>report</goal> </goals> </execution> </executions> </plugin>\n\n6.

          "page_content": "Test Coverage Goals Test Coverage Goals The CountYourWords project aims to achieve comprehensive test coverage to ensure its reliability and maintainability. The specific test coverage targets are outlined below: 1. Code Coverage Target Our primary goal is to achieve a minimum code coverage of 90% across all source files. This target ensures that the majority of the application's functionality is tested, reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving overall software quality. Example: java // CountYourWords.java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { // Implementation details... } } 2. Unit Test Coverage Target For each unit (method or function), we aim to achieve a minimum of 80% coverage. This ensures that individual components are thoroughly tested and behave as expected. Example: ```java // CountYourWordsTest.java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList assertEquals(\"Total words should be 0\", 0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(\"Word counts map should be empty\", result.getSecond().isEmpty()); } } ``` 3. Integration Test Coverage Target Integration tests are crucial for ensuring that different components of the application work together seamlessly. We aim to achieve a minimum of 70% coverage in integration tests. Example: ```java // SortTest.java public class SortTest { @Test public void sortMultipleTest() { HashMap List<String> expectedKeys = Arrays.asList(\"apple 1\", \"banana 1\", \"cherry 1\"); List<String> actualKeys = sortedArray; assertEquals(\"Keys should be sorted\", expectedKeys, actualKeys); } } ``` 4. Test Coverage Metrics To measure and track our progress towards these goals, we use several metrics: Line Coverage: The percentage of lines executed during tests. Branch Coverage: The percentage of branches (e.g., if statements) that are tested. Method Coverage: The percentage of methods that have at least one test case. 5. Test Coverage Tools We utilize tools like JaCoCo and SonarQube to automatically measure and report on our test coverage. These tools help us identify untested code and ensure continuous improvement in our testing strategy. Example JaCoCo Configuration: xml <plugin> <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId> <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId> <version>0.8.7</version> <executions> <execution> <goals> <goal>prepare-agent</goal> </goals> </execution> <execution> <id>report</id> <phase>test</phase> <goals> <goal>report</goal> </goals> </execution> </executions> </plugin> 6.",

Below is a detailed breakdown of how the output is generated: ```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); System.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \"); // Reading File name String path = \"\"; try { path = br.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path); Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); ArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond()); System.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst()); for (String line : finaList) { System.out.println(line); } } ``` Reading the File Path: The program prompts the user to enter a file path and reads it from the standard input. File Reading: The readFile method in the CountYourWords.java class is called to read the contents of the specified file into an ArrayList<String>. Word Counting: The count method processes the list of lines, counts the occurrences of each word, and returns a Pair object containing the total number of words and a map of word frequencies. ",

          "page_content": "Word Counting\n\nWord Counting\n\nThe CountYourWords system is designed to count words in a given text input. This process involves several key steps, including tokenization, normalization, and counting. Below, we will delve into the details of how these steps are implemented within the system.\n\nTokenization\n\nTokenization is the first step in word counting. It involves breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords system uses a simple regular expression to identify words:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> tokenize(String text) { return Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\W+\")); }\n\nThis method splits the input text using any non-word character (\\\\W+) as the delimiter. The resulting list of tokens is then returned.\n\nNormalization\n\nNormalization involves converting all words to a consistent case (typically lowercase) to ensure that word counts are case-insensitive. This step helps in accurately counting occurrences of the same word regardless of its case:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> normalize(List<String> tokens) { return tokens.stream() .map(String::toLowerCase) .collect(Collectors.toList()); }\n\nThe normalize method takes a list of tokens and converts each token to lowercase using the String.toLowerCase() method. The resulting normalized list is then returned.\n\nCounting\n\nThe counting step involves iterating over the normalized list of words and keeping track of their occurrences. This can be efficiently done using a HashMap:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static Map<String, Integer> count(List<String> tokens) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String token : tokens) { wordCounts.put(token, wordCounts.getOrDefault(token, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; }\n\nThe count method takes a list of normalized tokens and iterates over each token. For each token, it updates the count in the wordCounts map using the getOrDefault method to handle cases where the token is not yet present in the map.\n\nEdge Cases\n\nHandling edge cases is crucial for robust word counting. Some common edge cases include:\n\nEmpty Input: If the input text is empty, the system should return a count of 0.\n\nPunctuation: Punctuation marks should be ignored when counting words. For example, \"hello,\" and \"hello\" should both be counted as \"hello\".\n\nCase Insensitivity: The word counting should be case-insensitive, so \"Hello\" and \"hello\" should be treated as the same word.\n\nThe provided test cases in CountYourWordsTest.java cover these edge cases:\n\n```java // src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\nassertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\nassertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n\n@Test public void testPunctuation() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(5, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"welcome\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"to\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n@Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(4, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nThese test cases ensure that the word counting system handles various edge cases correctly.\n\nPerformance Considerations\n\nFor large text inputs, performance can be a concern. The current implementation uses a simple HashMap for counting, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups. However, for very large inputs, this could become a bottleneck.\n\nTo improve performance, the system could use more advanced data structures or parallel processing techniques. For example, using a concurrent hash map (ConcurrentHashMap) or distributing the counting task across multiple threads could help handle larger inputs more efficiently.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords system provides a robust solution for counting words in text input. By breaking down the process into tokenization, normalization, and counting, the system ensures accurate word counts while handling various edge cases. The provided test cases validate the correctness of the implementation, and further performance optimizations can be considered for larger inputs.\n\nFor more detailed information on the CountYourWords project, refer to the project's README file.",

This feature allows users to input file paths and view word counts and their occurrences.\n\nExample Code:\n\n```java // src/main/App.java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length == 0) { System.out.println(\"Please provide a file path as an argument.\"); return; }\n\n    String filePath = args[0];\n    try {\n        ArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(filePath);\n        Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n        ArrayList<String> sortedArray = Sort.sort(result.getSecond());\n\n        System.out.println(\"Total words: \" + result.getFirst());\n        for (String entry : sortedArray) {\n            System.out.println(entry);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        System.err.println(\"Error reading file: \" + e.getMessage());\n    }\n}\n\nprivate static ArrayList<String> readFile(String filePath) throws IOException {\n    ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            lines.add(line);\n        }\n    }\n    return lines;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTesting\n\nCountYourWords is thoroughly tested to ensure its reliability and correctness. The testing framework includes unit tests for both the word counting and sorting functionalities.\n\nExample Test Code:\n\n```java // src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\n    assertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\n    assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testSingleLine() {\n    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();\n    fileLines.add(\"Hello world\");\n\n    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\n    assertEquals(2, result.getFirst());\n\n    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\n    expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1);\n\n    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testMultipleLines() {\n    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();\n    fileLines.add(\"Hello world\");\n    fileLines.add(\"This is a test.\");\n    fileLines.add(\"World of Java!\");\n\n    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\n    assertEquals(9, result.getFirst());\n\n    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\n    expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\n    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships between the key components of CountYourWords:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[App.java] --> B[CountYourWords.java]; A --> C[Sort.java]; B --> D[readFile(String filePath)]; B --> E[count(ArrayList<String> fileLines)]; E --> F[sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts)];\n\nThis diagram shows how the App class interacts with the CountYourWords and Sort classes to process a text file and display the results.",

This project aims to adhere to several key constraints and objectives:\n\nInput Processing:\n\nThe application reads from input.txt, which contains text data.\n\nNumbers, special characters, and case sensitivity are ignored during processing.\n\nOutput Requirements:\n\nThe total number of words in the document is displayed.\n\nEach word's occurrence count is shown on the screen, sorted alphabetically.\n\nWord counts are case insensitive (e.g., \"Matchbox\", \"matchbox\", and \"MATCHBOX\" are treated as the same word).\n\nCode Quality:\n\nThe code must be production-ready, using best practices in object-oriented programming and design patterns such as SOLID principles.\n\nTesting and TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodologies are strictly enforced to ensure code quality and reliability.\n\nImplementation Details:\n\nAll classes can be contained within a single .NET Core console application.\n\nA custom sorting algorithm must be implemented, as built-in sort routines are not allowed.\n\nDependencies:\n\nThird-party components may be used except for the sorting functionality, which must be implemented in-house.\n\nExample Usage\n\nThe application processes input.txt and outputs results based on the specified rules. For example, if input.txt contains:\n\nHello world This is a test. World of Java!\n\nThe output might be:\n\nTotal words: 9 hello 1 is 1 java 1 of 1 test 1 this 1 world 2\n\nCode Snippets\n\nBelow are snippets from the CountYourWords project that demonstrate key components of the implementation.\n\nCountYourWords.java\n\nThis class contains the main logic for processing the input and counting words.\n\n```java import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class CountYourWords { public static Pair count(ArrayList\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    ArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(\"input.txt\");\n    Pair result = count(fileLines);\n    System.out.println(\"Total words: \" + result.getFirst());\n    for (String entry : sort(result.getSecond())) {\n        System.out.println(entry);\n    }\n}\n\nprivate static ArrayList<String> readFile(String fileName) {\n    ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            lines.add(line);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n    return lines;\n}\n\nprivate static ArrayList<String> sort(Map<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    // Custom sorting logic here\n    return new ArrayList<>();\n}\n\n} ```\n\nPair.java\n\nThis class represents a pair of values, typically used to return multiple results from methods.\n\n```java public class Pair { private int first; private Map\n\npublic Pair(int first, Map<String, Integer> second) {\n    this.first = first;\n    this.second = second;\n}\n\npublic int getFirst() {\n    return first;\n}\n\npublic Map<String, Integer> getSecond() {\n    return second;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSort.java\n\nThis class contains the custom sorting logic for word counts.\n\n```java import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.Collections; import java.util.Comparator;\n\npublic class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the class relationships and dependencies within the CountYourWords project.\n\nmermaid graph TD A[CountYourWords] --> B[Pair] A --> C[Sort] B --> D{Read File} C --> E{Custom Sort}\n\nConclusion\n\nThe primary goal of CountYourWords is to create a text parser that processes input from input.txt, counts words, and outputs the results in a specified format. The project adheres to strict constraints and objectives, including production-ready code, TDD, and custom sorting logic. The provided code snippets and mermaid diagram illustrate key components of the implementation.",

Numbers, special characters, and case sensitivity are ignored during processing. Output Requirements: The total number of words in the document is displayed. Each word's occurrence count is shown on the screen, sorted alphabetically. Word counts are case insensitive (e.g., \"Matchbox\", \"matchbox\", and \"MATCHBOX\" are treated as the same word).

This section outlines the key security measures in place, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption.\n\nAuthentication\n\nAuthentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting them access to the system. In CountYourWords, authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user logs in, they provide their credentials, which are verified against the stored credentials. If the credentials are valid, a JWT is issued and returned to the client.\n\njava // Example of JWT generation in Java String token = Jwts.builder() .setSubject(user.getUsername()) .setIssuedAt(new Date()) .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000)) // 1 day validity .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, \"secretKey\") .compact();\n\nThe JWT is then used in subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The server verifies the token's signature and expiration before granting access.\n\nAuthorization\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining what actions a user can perform within the system.

Each endpoint has associated roles that determine which users are allowed to access it.\n\n```java // Example of securing an endpoint in Spring Security @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/api\") public class WordController {\n\n@GetMapping(\"/words\")\n@PreAuthorize(\"hasRole('USER')\")\npublic List<String> getWords() {\n    // Endpoint logic here\n}\n\n} ```\n\nIn this example, the /api/words endpoint is accessible only to users with the USER role.\n\nData Encryption\n\nData encryption is used to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit.

          "page_content": "Security Architecture Security Architecture The security architecture of CountYourWords is designed to protect the system from unauthorized access and ensure data integrity. This section outlines the key security measures in place, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption. Authentication Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting them access to the system. In CountYourWords, authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user logs in, they provide their credentials, which are verified against the stored credentials. If the credentials are valid, a JWT is issued and returned to the client. java // Example of JWT generation in Java String token = Jwts.builder() .setSubject(user.getUsername()) .setIssuedAt(new Date()) .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000)) // 1 day validity .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, \"secretKey\") .compact(); The JWT is then used in subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The server verifies the token's signature and expiration before granting access. Authorization Authorization is the process of determining what actions a user can perform within the system. In CountYourWords, authorization is enforced using Spring Security. Each endpoint has associated roles that determine which users are allowed to access it. ```java // Example of securing an endpoint in Spring Security @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/api\") public class WordController { @GetMapping(\"/words\") @PreAuthorize(\"hasRole('USER')\") public List<String> getWords() { // Endpoint logic here } } ``` In this example, the /api/words endpoint is accessible only to users with the USER role. Data Encryption Data encryption is used to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit. In CountYourWords, data is encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) when stored in the database. Additionally, all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS. java // Example of encrypting data using AES in Java public byte[] encrypt(byte[] data, SecretKey secretKey) throws Exception { Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\"); cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey); return cipher.doFinal(data); } The encryption key is securely stored and managed to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt the data.",

Below, we will detail each major component, explaining their purpose and role in the system.\n\n1. App.java\n\nPurpose: The App.java class serves as the entry point for the application. It initializes the necessary components and orchestrates the flow of data through the system.\n\n```java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { // Initialize dependencies TextParser parser = new TextParser(); WordCounter counter = new WordCounter(); OutputFormatter formatter = new OutputFormatter();\n\n    // Read input file and parse text\n    String inputText = parser.readInputFile(\"input.txt\");\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = counter.countWords(inputText);\n\n    // Format and output results\n    List<String> sortedWordCounts = formatter.sortAndFormat(wordCounts);\n    for (String line : sortedWordCounts) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/App.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n2. TextParser.java\n\nPurpose: The TextParser.java class is responsible for reading the input text file and preparing it for further processing.\n\njava public class TextParser { public String readInputFile(String filePath) { // Read the contents of the input.txt file return new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(filePath))); } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/TextParser.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n3. WordCounter.java\n\nPurpose: The WordCounter.java class counts the occurrences of each word in the input text, ignoring numbers and special characters.\n\njava public class WordCounter { public Map<String, Integer> countWords(String text) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); String[] words = text.split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word.toLowerCase(), wordCounts.getOrDefault(word.toLowerCase(), 0) + 1); } } return wordCounts; } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/WordCounter.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n4. OutputFormatter.java\n\nPurpose: The OutputFormatter.java class formats the word counts for output, sorting them alphabetically and displaying each word with its count.\n\n```java public class OutputFormatter { public List\n\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : sortedWordCounts) {\n        System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue());\n    }\n    return sortedWordCounts;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/OutputFormatter.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n5. Sort.java\n\nPurpose: The Sort.java class contains a simple insertion sort algorithm to sort the words alphabetically.\n\njava public class Sort { public static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) { ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array)); for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) { String key = list.get(i); int j = i - 1; while (j >= 0 && list.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) { list.set(j + 1, list.get(j)); j--; } list.set(j + 1, key); } return list; } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/Sort.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n6. Pair.java\n\nPurpose: The Pair.java class is a utility class that holds pairs of values, which could be used in various parts of the system for storing related data.\n\n```java public class Pair\n\npublic Pair(K key, V value) {\n    this.key = key;\n    this.value = value;\n}\n\npublic K getKey() {\n    return key;\n}\n\npublic V getValue() {\n    return value;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/Pair.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n7. Unit Tests\n\nThe project includes several unit tests to ensure the correctness of each component.\n\nCountYourWordsTest.java: Tests the functionality of the WordCounter and OutputFormatter classes.\n\nSortTest.java: Tests the sorting functionality in the Sort class.\n\nSources: - CountYourWords/src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here] - CountYourWords/src/test/SortTest.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\nThese tests utilize JUnit for assertions and Hamcrest for more expressive matchers.\n\n```java import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { WordCounter counter = new WordCounter(); String inputText = \"hello world hello\"; Map\n\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"hello\"), is(2));\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"world\"), is(1));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the component interactions within the CountYourWords project:\n\nmermaid graph TD; App --> TextParser; App --> WordCounter; App --> OutputFormatter; TextParser --> WordCounter; WordCounter --> OutputFormatter; OutputFormatter --> App;\n\nThis diagram shows how data flows through the system, starting from reading the input file in App, parsing it in TextParser, counting words in WordCounter, and finally formatting and outputting the results in OutputFormatter.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project is designed with a clear separation of concerns, making each component responsible for a specific aspect of the system. This modular approach facilitates maintenance, testing, and scalability. The provided code snippets and diagrams should give you a comprehensive understanding of how each component works together to achieve the project's goal.",

This ensures that all modifications are recorded, allowing for collaboration among team members and easy rollback if necessary.\n\nConfiguration\n\nGit is configured with a .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control. The .gitignore file includes entries for compiled class files (*.class), IDE-specific configuration files (e.g., .vscode/), and temporary files (*.tmp). This helps keep the repository clean and focused on source code.\n\n```plaintext\n\nIgnore compiled Java classes\n\n.class\n\nIgnore Visual Studio Code specific files\n\n.vscode/\n\nIgnore temporary files\n\n.tmp ```\n\nWorkflow\n\nThe development workflow in CountYourWords follows a standard Git branching model:\n\nMaster Branch: This branch contains the production-ready code and is protected against direct commits.\n\nFeature Branches: Developers create feature branches for new features or bug fixes. These branches are created from the master branch and merged back into it once completed.\n\nPull Requests (PRs): Before merging a feature branch into master, developers submit a pull request. This allows other team members to review the changes before they are integrated.\n\nRepository Structure\n\nThe repository is structured as follows:\n\nplaintext CountYourWords/ ├── lib/ │ ├── hamcrest-core-1.3.jar │ └── junit-4.13.2.jar ├── readme.md ├── src/ │ ├── main/ │ │ ├── App.java │ │ ├── CountYourWords.java │ │ ├── Pair.java │ │ └── Sort.java │ └── test/ │ ├── CountYourWordsTest.java │ ├── SortTest.java │ └── textTests/ │ ├── emptyFile.txt │ ├── exampleFile.txt │ ├── nonPeriodFile.txt │ └── validFile.txt └── .gitignore\n\nExample Commit\n\nHere is an example of a Git commit message for adding a new feature:\n\n```plaintext feat: Add word count functionality\n\nImplemented the countWords method in CountYourWords.java\n\nAdded unit tests for the countWords method in CountYourWordsTest.java ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the Git branching model used in CountYourWords:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[Master] --> B[Feature Branch]; B --> C[Merge Request]; C --> D[Review and Merge]; D --> E[Production Deployment];\n\nThis diagram shows the flow of changes from the master branch to feature branches, through pull requests for review, and finally to production deployment.\n\nConclusion\n\nGit is a robust version control system that facilitates collaboration, code management, and rollback capabilities.

Counting Words: The count method processes the list of lines, counting the occurrences of each word and returning a Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>>. The first element of the pair is the total number of words, and the second is a map where keys are words and values are their counts. 3. Sorting Words: The sort method takes the map of word counts and sorts them by frequency in descending order, returning an ArrayList<String>.\n\nOutput Stage\n\nThe output stage displays the results to the user.

Below are the details of the specific versions and features utilized in CountYourWords.\n\nJava Version\n\nCountYourWords is built on Java version 11 (JDK 11). This version was chosen for its balance between performance, security, and feature set, making it suitable for both development and production environments.\n\njava // Example of setting the Java version in a build tool like Maven <properties> <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source> <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target> </properties>\n\nKey Libraries and Dependencies\n\nHamcrest Core (Version 1.3)\n\nHamcrest is used for writing readable assertions in tests. It provides a more expressive way to write test cases compared to traditional JUnit assertions.\n\n```java // Example of using Hamcrest in a test case import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;\n\n@Test public void testSingleLine() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertThat(result.getFirst(), equalTo(2));\n\n} ```\n\nJUnit 4 (Version 4.13.2)\n\nJUnit is the de-facto standard for writing repeatable tests in Java. It provides a simple and flexible framework to create and run tests.\n\n```java // Example of a JUnit test class import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\n    assertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\n    assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n}\n\n} ```\n\nProgramming Language Features Utilized\n\nObject-Oriented Programming (OOP)\n\nCountYourWords is designed using OOP principles. It includes classes such as CountYourWords, Sort, and Pair to encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability.\n\n```java // Example of a simple class in CountYourWords public class CountYourWords { public static Pair count(ArrayList\n\npublic static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    // Implementation details\n}\n\n} ```\n\nGenerics\n\nGenerics are used extensively to ensure type safety and reduce the need for casting.\n\n```java // Example of using generics in CountYourWords public class Pair\n\npublic Pair(T first, R second) {\n    this.first = first;\n    this.second = second;\n}\n\n// Getters and setters\n\n} ```\n\nLambda Expressions and Streams\n\nLambda expressions and streams are used to simplify data processing and manipulation.\n\njava // Example of using lambda expressions and streams in CountYourWords public static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) { return wordCounts.entrySet().stream() .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue(Comparator.reverseOrder())) .map(entry -> entry.getKey() + \" \" + entry.getValue()) .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new)); }\n\nConclusion\n\nCountYourWords is a well-structured Java application that leverages modern language features and popular libraries to ensure robustness, readability, and maintainability. The use of Java 11, Hamcrest, and JUnit contributes to the project's reliability and ease of testing.",

The Pair class is also used to encapsulate two pieces of related information: the total number of words and the word count map: ```java public final class Pair { private final int totalCount; private final HashMap public Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) { this.totalCount = first; this.wordCounts = second; } public int getFirst() { return totalCount; } public HashMap<String, Integer> getSecond() { return wordCounts; } } ``` The Pair class provides a convenient way to return two values from the count method.",

This pipeline consists of several stages, each with a specific role in processing the data. Below, we will outline each stage and detail any intermediate data transformations or calculations.\n\n1. Reading Input File\n\nThe first step in the pipeline is reading the input file. The App class prompts the user to enter a file path and reads the contents of the specified file using the readFile method from the CountYourWords class.\n\njava public static ArrayList<String> readFile(String path) throws FileNotFoundException { ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>(); try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(path))) { String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { lines.add(line); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } return lines; }\n\nSource: App.java, PK: ac863f346e618f9a959b5c95d5d28941\n\n2. Counting Words\n\nThe next stage is counting the words in the input file. The count method from the CountYourWords class processes each line, splits it into words, and counts their occurrences.\n\n```java public static Pair count(ArrayList\n\nfor (String line : lines) {\n    String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty() && !Character.isDigit(word.charAt(0))) {\n            word = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n            totalWords++;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nreturn new Pair(totalWords, wordCount);\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n3. Sorting Words\n\nAfter counting the words, the next step is sorting them by frequency. The sort method from the Sort class implements a custom sorting algorithm to sort the word counts.\n\n```java public static ArrayList\n\nArrayList<String> sortedList = new ArrayList<>();\nfor (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) {\n    sortedList.add(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue());\n}\n\nreturn sortedList;\n\n} ```\n\nSource: Sort.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n4. Outputting Results\n\nFinally, the processed data is outputted to the console. The main method in the App class prints the total number of words and each word's count.\n\n```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \");\nString path = \"\";\ntry {\n    path = br.readLine();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(path);\nPair wordTotalCount = count(fileLines);\nArrayList<String> finaList = sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond());\nSystem.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst());\nfor (String line : finaList) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: App.java, PK: ac863f346e618f9a959b5c95d5d28941\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data through the Data Processing Pipeline:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[Read Input File] --> B[Count Words]; B --> C[Sort Words]; C --> D[Output Results];\n\nThis diagram shows the sequence of steps from reading the input file to outputting the results, highlighting each stage in the pipeline.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Data Processing Pipeline in CountYourWords is a structured approach to transforming raw input into processed output. Each stage plays a crucial role in ensuring that the data is accurately counted and sorted before being presented to the user. By following this pipeline, the application meets its goal of providing a robust solution for word count analysis while adhering to the specified constraints and requirements.",

          "page_content": "Result Formatting Result Formatting The Result Formatting section describes how the word count results are formatted for display. The primary goal is to ensure that the output is clear, consistent, and easy to understand. Output Structure The result of a word count operation is typically structured as a Pair object, where the first element represents the total number of words and the second element is a HashMap containing the frequency of each word. This structure allows for both a summary statistic and detailed breakdown of the word distribution. ```java public class Pair { private int first; private HashMap public Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) { this.first = first; this.second = second; } // Getters and setters } ``` Formatting Rules Total Word Count: The total word count is displayed at the top of the output. Word Frequency Table: A table is generated to show each unique word along with its frequency. Example Output Given a file with the following content: Hello world This is a test. World of Java! The output might look like this: ```plaintext Total Words: 9 Word Frequency hello 1 world 2 this 1 is 1 a 1 test 1 of 1 java 1 ``` Code Implementation The CountYourWords class contains the logic to perform the word count and format the output. Below is an example implementation: ```java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair count(ArrayList for (String line : fileLines) { String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\s+\"); totalWords += words.length; for (String word : words) { word = word.toLowerCase().replaceAll(\"[^a-z0-9]\", \"\"); if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } } return new Pair(totalWords, wordCounts); } } ``` Testing To ensure the formatting is correct, unit tests are provided. Below is an example test case: ```java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testMultipleLines() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(9, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2); expectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } } ```",
