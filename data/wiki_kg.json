        "page_content": "Text Analysis\n\nText Analysis\n\nCountYourWords provides robust text analysis capabilities to help users understand and extract meaningful information from textual data. This section delves into the features related to analyzing text, such as frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.\n\nFrequency Analysis\n\nFrequency analysis is a fundamental technique used to determine how often each word appears in a given text. CountYourWords uses this feature to provide insights into the distribution of words within a document. The following code snippet demonstrates how frequency analysis can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class FrequencyAnalyzer { public static Map\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return wordCount;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\";\n    Map<String, Integer> frequencyMap = analyzeFrequency(text);\n    System.out.println(frequencyMap);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nSentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. CountYourWords utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis. The following code snippet illustrates how sentiment analysis can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class SentimentAnalyzer { private static final Map\n\nstatic {\n    sentimentScores.put(\"happy\", 1);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"sad\", -1);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"angry\", -2);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"excited\", 2);\n}\n\npublic static int analyzeSentiment(String text) {\n    String[] words = text.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\");\n    int sentimentScore = 0;\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (sentimentScores.containsKey(word)) {\n            sentimentScore += sentimentScores.get(word);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return sentimentScore;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"I am very happy today. The weather is beautiful.\";\n    int sentiment = analyzeSentiment(text);\n    System.out.println(\"Sentiment Score: \" + sentiment);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nKeyword Extraction\n\nKeyword extraction involves identifying the most important words or phrases in a piece of text. CountYourWords uses techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract keywords. The following code snippet demonstrates how keyword extraction can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class KeywordExtractor { public static Map\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    double totalWords = wordCount.size();\n    Map<String, Double> keywordScores = new HashMap<>();\n\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) {\n        String word = entry.getKey();\n        int count = entry.getValue();\n        double score = (count / totalWords) * Math.log(totalWords / 1.0); // Simplified TF-IDF\n        keywordScores.put(word, score);\n    }\n\n    return keywordScores;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\";\n    Map<String, Double> keywords = extractKeywords(text);\n    System.out.println(keywords);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTools and Libraries\n\nCountYourWords leverages several tools and libraries to enhance its text analysis capabilities:\n\nJava Collections Framework: Used for data structures like HashMap to store word counts.\n\nJUnit: For unit testing the text analysis features, ensuring they work as expected.\n\nHamcrest Core: Provides matchers for assertions in JUnit tests.\n\nThese tools and libraries help ensure that CountYourWords is both efficient and reliable in its text analysis tasks.",

These tools enhance various aspects of the application, from testing and assertions to sorting algorithms.\n\nHamcrest Core (hamcrest-core-1.3.jar)\n\nPurpose: Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects in Java. It provides a more readable way to assert conditions in tests compared to traditional JUnit assertions.\n\nRole: This library is used extensively for creating custom matchers in the test suite, making it easier to write expressive and maintainable test cases.\n\nJUnit (junit-4.13.2.jar)\n\nPurpose: JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java applications. It allows developers to write repeatable tests that validate their code.\n\nRole: The CountYourWords project uses JUnit to create unit tests for its core functionality, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under various conditions.\n\nCustom Libraries and Classes\n\nIn addition to external libraries, the CountYourWords project includes several custom classes and utilities:\n\nPair Class (src/main/Pair.java)\n\nPurpose: The Pair class is a simple utility class used to store two related objects together. It is particularly useful in sorting algorithms where pairs of words and their counts need to be maintained.\n\nRole: This class simplifies the handling of word-count pairs, making the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nSort Class (src/main/Sort.java)\n\nPurpose: The Sort class contains various sorting algorithms. Currently, it includes an insertion sort implementation, which is used to sort words alphabetically before counting their occurrences.\n\nRole: This class encapsulates the logic for sorting operations, ensuring that the main application logic remains clean and focused on word processing.\n\nExample Code Snippets\n\nBelow are some example code snippets demonstrating the use of these frameworks and libraries:\n\nHamcrest Matcher Example (src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java)\n\n```java import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { // Arrange String input = \"hello world hello\"; CountYourWords countYourWords = new CountYourWords();\n\n    // Act\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = countYourWords.countWords(input);\n\n    // Assert\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"hello\"), equalTo(2));\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"world\"), equalTo(1));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nJUnit Test Example (src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java)\n\n```java import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { // Arrange String input = \"hello world hello\"; CountYourWords countYourWords = new CountYourWords();\n\n    // Act\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = countYourWords.countWords(input);\n\n    // Assert\n    assertEquals(2, (int) wordCounts.get(\"hello\"));\n    assertEquals(1, (int) wordCounts.get(\"world\"));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSort Algorithm Example (src/main/Sort.java)\n\n```java import java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    ArrayList<String> sortedList = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (String s : array) {\n        sortedList.add(s);\n    }\n    return sortedList;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships between the main components of the CountYourWords project:\n\nmermaid graph TD A[CountYourWords.java] --> B[Sort.java] A --> C[Pair.java] B --> D[junit-4.13.2.jar] C --> E[hamcrest-core-1.3.jar]\n\nThis diagram shows how the main application class depends on sorting and utility classes, which in turn depend on testing and assertion libraries.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project leverages several frameworks and libraries to enhance its development process. Hamcrest and JUnit provide robust testing capabilities, while custom classes like Pair and Sort encapsulate specific functionality. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for anyone working on or maintaining the CountYourWords project.",

The project adheres to specific constraints, including ignoring numbers, special characters, and case sensitivity. The goal of the project is to produce production-ready code with comprehensive testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Additionally, the application must be designed following SOLID principles and object-oriented programming practices.\n\nProject Structure\n\nThe CountYourWords project has a structured file tree as follows:\n\nCountYourWords/ ├── lib/ │ ├── hamcrest-core-1.3.jar │ └── junit-4.13.2.jar ├── readme.md ├── src/ │ ├── main/ │ │ ├── App.java │ │ ├── CountYourWords.java │ │ ├── Pair.java │ │ └── Sort.java │ └── test/ │ ├── CountYourWordsTest.java │ ├── SortTest.java │ └── textTests/ │ ├── emptyFile.txt │ ├── exampleFile.txt │ ├── nonPeriodFile.txt │ └── validFile.txt\n\nKey Components\n\n1. readme.md\n\nThis file provides a detailed overview of the project, including its description, constraints, and goals. It serves as the primary documentation for developers.\n\nExample Content: ```markdown\n\nProject Description\n\nI am creating a text parser in Java named CountYourWords.\n\nConstraints\n\nNumbers in the document are ignored and are not processed\n\nOther characters than words should be filtered out of the input, so ## or @ or !! are ignored\n\nYou do not have to take in account strange combinations like: love4u or mail@address.nl, combinations like these are out of scope for this assignment\n\nNext to showing the total number of words in the document, the number of occurrences of each word is also calculated\n\nThe total number of occurrences next to the word must be shown on screen one by one (in lowercase)\n\nCounting the occurrences per word is case insensitive (so Matchbox, matchbox, and MATCHBOX are all the same word)\n\nWhen printing the occurrences, the words must be in alphabetical order\n\nYou cannot use a built-in .NET sort routine, so produce on of your own, it does not have to be the fastest sort-routine as long as it is reliable end reusable.\n\nThe document is a text file that will be read by your console app and has the fixed name: input.txt\n\nGoal\n\nThe code must be production code, use everything you would use in production. You are allowed to use third party components if required (except for the sorting)\n\nAll classes can be in one .NET core console application (assembly), as long as you show clear separation\n\nEverything must be done using testing and TDD\n\nUse SOLID and object-oriented programming ```\n\n2. CountYourWords.java\n\nThis is the main class of the project, responsible for orchestrating the word counting process.\n\nExample Code: ```java import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.HashMap;\n\npublic class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { String fileName = \"input.txt\"; HashMap\n\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\");\n            for (String word : words) {\n                if (!word.isEmpty() && !Character.isDigit(word.charAt(0))) {\n                    wordCounts.put(word.toLowerCase(), wordCounts.getOrDefault(word.toLowerCase(), 0) + 1);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        ArrayList<String> sortedWordCounts = Sort.sort(wordCounts);\n        for (String entry : sortedWordCounts) {\n            System.out.println(entry);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\n3. Sort.java\n\nThis class contains a method to sort the word counts alphabetically.\n\nExample Code: ```java import java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\npublic static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    ArrayList<String> sortedWordCounts = new ArrayList<>();\n    // Sort the words first\n    ArrayList<String> sortedWords = insertionSort(wordCounts.keySet().toArray(new String[0]));\n\n    // Now to add the values back\n    for (String word : sortedWords) {\n        String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word));\n        String fString = word + \" \" + value;\n        sortedWordCounts.add(fString);\n    }\n\n    return sortedWordCounts;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships and dependencies within the CountYourWords project:\n\nmermaid graph TD A[CountYourWords.java] --> B(App.java) A --> C(CountYourWords.java) A --> D(Sort.java) B --> E(CountYourWords.java) C --> F(Sort.java) D --> G(Sort.java)\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project is a comprehensive text parser that processes an input file to count words and their occurrences.

These integration points are crucial for understanding how various parts of the system interact with each other and with external resources.\n\nInternal Component Integration\n\nThe primary internal component in CountYourWords is the CountYourWords class, which handles the main logic for counting words in a text file. This class interacts with several other components:\n\nPair Class: The Pair class is used to store and return results from word count operations. It encapsulates two values: a total count of words and a HashMap mapping each word to its frequency.\n\n```java public final class Pair { private final int totalCount; private final HashMap\n\n   public Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) {\n       this.totalCount = first;\n       this.wordCounts = second;\n   }\n\n   public int getFirst() {\n       return totalCount;\n   }\n\n   public HashMap<String, Integer> getSecond() {\n       return wordCounts;\n   }\n\n} ```\n\nSort Class: The Sort class is responsible for sorting the results based on word frequency. It takes a Pair object as input and returns a sorted list of words.\n\njava public class Sort { public List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> sort(Pair pair) { List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entries = new ArrayList<>(pair.getSecond().entrySet()); Collections.sort(entries, (e1, e2) -> e2.getValue().compareTo(e1.getValue())); return entries; } }\n\nExternal System Integration\n\nCountYourWords interacts with external systems primarily through file operations. The project includes several test files located in the src/test/textTests directory:\n\nemptyFile.txt: An empty file used to test edge cases.\n\nexampleFile.txt: A sample text file containing words for word count.\n\nnonPeriodFile.txt: A file without periods, which might affect word separation logic.\n\nvalidFile.txt: A valid text file with proper formatting.\n\nThese files are read by the CountYourWords class to perform word counting operations. The project also includes test cases in the src/test/java/CountYourWordsTest.java and src/test/java/SortTest.java files, which utilize these external resources to validate the functionality of the system.\n\nIntegration Diagram\n\nTo better visualize the integration points within CountYourWords, a Mermaid diagram can be used:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[CountYourWords] --> B[Pair] A --> C[Sort] B --> D[Sort] C --> E[Test Cases] D --> F[Test Cases]\n\nThis diagram shows the flow of data and control within the CountYourWords system, highlighting how CountYourWords interacts with the Pair and Sort classes, as well as external test cases.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the integration points in CountYourWords are primarily internal component interactions (e.g., between CountYourWords, Pair, and Sort) and external system interactions (e.g., file operations for word counting). Understanding these integration points is essential for comprehending how different parts of the system work together to achieve its overall functionality.",

        "page_content": "Word Counting\n\nWord Counting\n\nThe CountYourWords system is designed to count words in a given text input. This process involves several key steps, including tokenization, normalization, and counting. Below, we will delve into the details of how these steps are implemented within the system.\n\nTokenization\n\nTokenization is the first step in word counting. It involves breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords system uses a simple regular expression to identify words:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> tokenize(String text) { return Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\W+\")); }\n\nThis method splits the input text using any non-word character (\\\\W+) as the delimiter. The resulting list of tokens is then returned.\n\nNormalization\n\nNormalization involves converting all words to a consistent case (typically lowercase) to ensure that word counts are case-insensitive. This step helps in accurately counting occurrences of the same word regardless of its case:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> normalize(List<String> tokens) { return tokens.stream() .map(String::toLowerCase) .collect(Collectors.toList()); }\n\nThe normalize method takes a list of tokens and converts each token to lowercase using the String.toLowerCase() method. The resulting normalized list is then returned.\n\nCounting\n\nThe counting step involves iterating over the normalized list of words and keeping track of their occurrences. This can be efficiently done using a HashMap:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static Map<String, Integer> count(List<String> tokens) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String token : tokens) { wordCounts.put(token, wordCounts.getOrDefault(token, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; }\n\nThe count method takes a list of normalized tokens and iterates over each token. For each token, it updates the count in the wordCounts map using the getOrDefault method to handle cases where the token is not yet present in the map.\n\nEdge Cases\n\nHandling edge cases is crucial for robust word counting. Some common edge cases include:\n\nEmpty Input: If the input text is empty, the system should return a count of 0.\n\nPunctuation: Punctuation marks should be ignored when counting words. For example, \"hello,\" and \"hello\" should both be counted as \"hello\".\n\nCase Insensitivity: The word counting should be case-insensitive, so \"Hello\" and \"hello\" should be treated as the same word.\n\nThe provided test cases in CountYourWordsTest.java cover these edge cases:\n\n```java // src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\nassertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\nassertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n\n@Test public void testPunctuation() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(5, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"welcome\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"to\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n@Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(4, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nThese test cases ensure that the word counting system handles various edge cases correctly.\n\nPerformance Considerations\n\nFor large text inputs, performance can be a concern. The current implementation uses a simple HashMap for counting, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups. However, for very large inputs, this could become a bottleneck.\n\nTo improve performance, the system could use more advanced data structures or parallel processing techniques. For example, using a concurrent hash map (ConcurrentHashMap) or distributing the counting task across multiple threads could help handle larger inputs more efficiently.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords system provides a robust solution for counting words in text input. By breaking down the process into tokenization, normalization, and counting, the system ensures accurate word counts while handling various edge cases. The provided test cases validate the correctness of the implementation, and further performance optimizations can be considered for larger inputs.\n\nFor more detailed information on the CountYourWords project, refer to the project's README file.",

This feature ensures that each word's occurrence is accurately recorded, regardless of case sensitivity.\n\nExample Code:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String line : fileLines) { String[] words = line.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } } return new Pair<>(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts); } }\n\nText Analysis\n\nCountYourWords also includes a text analysis feature that sorts the words based on their frequency. This helps in understanding which words are most common in the text.\n\nExample Code:\n\n```java // src/main/Sort.java public class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    ArrayList<String> sortedArray = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) {\n        sortedArray.add(entry.getKey() + \" \" + entry.getValue());\n    }\n    return sortedArray;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nUser Interface Features\n\nWhile the primary focus is on backend functionality, CountYourWords also includes a simple user interface to interact with the application. This feature allows users to input file paths and view word counts and their occurrences.\n\nExample Code:\n\n```java // src/main/App.java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length == 0) { System.out.println(\"Please provide a file path as an argument.\"); return; }\n\n    String filePath = args[0];\n    try {\n        ArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(filePath);\n        Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n        ArrayList<String> sortedArray = Sort.sort(result.getSecond());\n\n        System.out.println(\"Total words: \" + result.getFirst());\n        for (String entry : sortedArray) {\n            System.out.println(entry);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        System.err.println(\"Error reading file: \" + e.getMessage());\n    }\n}\n\nprivate static ArrayList<String> readFile(String filePath) throws IOException {\n    ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>();\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            lines.add(line);\n        }\n    }\n    return lines;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTesting\n\nCountYourWords is thoroughly tested to ensure its reliability and correctness. The testing framework includes unit tests for both the word counting and sorting functionalities.\n\nExample Test Code:\n\n```java // src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\n    assertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\n    assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testSingleLine() {\n    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();\n    fileLines.add(\"Hello world\");\n\n    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\n    assertEquals(2, result.getFirst());\n\n    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\n    expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1);\n\n    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n}\n\n@Test\npublic void testMultipleLines() {\n    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();\n    fileLines.add(\"Hello world\");\n    fileLines.add(\"This is a test.\");\n    fileLines.add(\"World of Java!\");\n\n    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\n    assertEquals(9, result.getFirst());\n\n    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\n    expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 2);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"this\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"is\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"a\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"test\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"of\", 1);\n    expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\n    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships between the key components of CountYourWords:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[App.java] --> B[CountYourWords.java]; A --> C[Sort.java]; B --> D[readFile(String filePath)]; B --> E[count(ArrayList<String> fileLines)]; E --> F[sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts)];\n\nThis diagram shows how the App class interacts with the CountYourWords and Sort classes to process a text file and display the results.",

This project aims to adhere to several key constraints and objectives:\n\nInput Processing:\n\nThe application reads from input.txt, which contains text data.\n\nNumbers, special characters, and case sensitivity are ignored during processing.\n\nOutput Requirements:\n\nThe total number of words in the document is displayed.\n\nEach word's occurrence count is shown on the screen, sorted alphabetically.\n\nWord counts are case insensitive (e.g., \"Matchbox\", \"matchbox\", and \"MATCHBOX\" are treated as the same word).\n\nCode Quality:\n\nThe code must be production-ready, using best practices in object-oriented programming and design patterns such as SOLID principles.\n\nTesting and TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodologies are strictly enforced to ensure code quality and reliability.\n\nImplementation Details:\n\nAll classes can be contained within a single .NET Core console application.\n\nA custom sorting algorithm must be implemented, as built-in sort routines are not allowed.\n\nDependencies:\n\nThird-party components may be used except for the sorting functionality, which must be implemented in-house.\n\nExample Usage\n\nThe application processes input.txt and outputs results based on the specified rules. For example, if input.txt contains:\n\nHello world This is a test.

This section outlines the key security measures in place, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption.\n\nAuthentication\n\nAuthentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting them access to the system. In CountYourWords, authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user logs in, they provide their credentials, which are verified against the stored credentials. If the credentials are valid, a JWT is issued and returned to the client.\n\njava // Example of JWT generation in Java String token = Jwts.builder() .setSubject(user.getUsername()) .setIssuedAt(new Date()) .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000)) // 1 day validity .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, \"secretKey\") .compact();\n\nThe JWT is then used in subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The server verifies the token's signature and expiration before granting access.\n\nAuthorization\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining what actions a user can perform within the system. In CountYourWords, authorization is enforced using Spring Security. Each endpoint has associated roles that determine which users are allowed to access it.\n\n```java // Example of securing an endpoint in Spring Security @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/api\") public class WordController {\n\n@GetMapping(\"/words\")\n@PreAuthorize(\"hasRole('USER')\")\npublic List<String> getWords() {\n    // Endpoint logic here\n}\n\n} ```\n\nIn this example, the /api/words endpoint is accessible only to users with the USER role.\n\nData Encryption\n\nData encryption is used to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit. In CountYourWords, data is encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) when stored in the database. Additionally, all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.\n\njava // Example of encrypting data using AES in Java public byte[] encrypt(byte[] data, SecretKey secretKey) throws Exception { Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\"); cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey); return cipher.doFinal(data); }\n\nThe encryption key is securely stored and managed to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt the data.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, CountYourWords employs a robust security architecture that includes authentication using JWTs, authorization using Spring Security roles, and data encryption using AES. These measures ensure that the system remains secure and protected against unauthorized access and data breaches.",

Below, we will detail each major component, explaining their purpose and role in the system.\n\n1. App.java\n\nPurpose: The App.java class serves as the entry point for the application. It initializes the necessary components and orchestrates the flow of data through the system.\n\n```java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { // Initialize dependencies TextParser parser = new TextParser(); WordCounter counter = new WordCounter(); OutputFormatter formatter = new OutputFormatter();\n\n    // Read input file and parse text\n    String inputText = parser.readInputFile(\"input.txt\");\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = counter.countWords(inputText);\n\n    // Format and output results\n    List<String> sortedWordCounts = formatter.sortAndFormat(wordCounts);\n    for (String line : sortedWordCounts) {\n        System.out.println(line);\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/App.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n2. TextParser.java\n\nPurpose: The TextParser.java class is responsible for reading the input text file and preparing it for further processing.\n\njava public class TextParser { public String readInputFile(String filePath) { // Read the contents of the input.txt file return new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get(filePath))); } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/TextParser.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n3. WordCounter.java\n\nPurpose: The WordCounter.java class counts the occurrences of each word in the input text, ignoring numbers and special characters.\n\njava public class WordCounter { public Map<String, Integer> countWords(String text) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); String[] words = text.split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word.toLowerCase(), wordCounts.getOrDefault(word.toLowerCase(), 0) + 1); } } return wordCounts; } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/WordCounter.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n4. OutputFormatter.java\n\nPurpose: The OutputFormatter.java class formats the word counts for output, sorting them alphabetically and displaying each word with its count.\n\n```java public class OutputFormatter { public List\n\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : sortedWordCounts) {\n        System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue());\n    }\n    return sortedWordCounts;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/OutputFormatter.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n5. Sort.java\n\nPurpose: The Sort.java class contains a simple insertion sort algorithm to sort the words alphabetically.\n\njava public class Sort { public static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) { ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array)); for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) { String key = list.get(i); int j = i - 1; while (j >= 0 && list.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) { list.set(j + 1, list.get(j)); j--; } list.set(j + 1, key); } return list; } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/Sort.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n6. Pair.java\n\nPurpose: The Pair.java class is a utility class that holds pairs of values, which could be used in various parts of the system for storing related data.\n\n```java public class Pair\n\npublic Pair(K key, V value) {\n    this.key = key;\n    this.value = value;\n}\n\npublic K getKey() {\n    return key;\n}\n\npublic V getValue() {\n    return value;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/Pair.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n7. Unit Tests\n\nThe project includes several unit tests to ensure the correctness of each component.\n\nCountYourWordsTest.java: Tests the functionality of the WordCounter and OutputFormatter classes.\n\nSortTest.java: Tests the sorting functionality in the Sort class.\n\nSources: - CountYourWords/src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here] - CountYourWords/src/test/SortTest.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\nThese tests utilize JUnit for assertions and Hamcrest for more expressive matchers.\n\n```java import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { WordCounter counter = new WordCounter(); String inputText = \"hello world hello\"; Map\n\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"hello\"), is(2));\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"world\"), is(1));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the component interactions within the CountYourWords project:\n\nmermaid graph TD; App --> TextParser; App --> WordCounter; App --> OutputFormatter; TextParser --> WordCounter; WordCounter --> OutputFormatter; OutputFormatter --> App;\n\nThis diagram shows how data flows through the system, starting from reading the input file in App, parsing it in TextParser, counting words in WordCounter, and finally formatting and outputting the results in OutputFormatter.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project is designed with a clear separation of concerns, making each component responsible for a specific aspect of the system. This modular approach facilitates maintenance, testing, and scalability.

The system follows a clear sequence from input to output, ensuring that each stage is well-defined and easily testable.\n\nInput Stage\n\nThe input stage begins with the user providing a file path through the console. This is handled by the main method in the App.java class:\n\n```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \");\n\n// Reading File name\nString path = \"\";\ntry {\n    path = br.readLine();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);\nPair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\nArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond());\nSystem.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst());\nfor (String line : finaList) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nProcessing Stage\n\nThe processing stage involves three main steps: 1. Reading the File: The readFile method in the CountYourWords.java class reads the file specified by the user and returns an ArrayList<String> containing each line of the file. 2. Counting Words: The count method processes the list of lines, counting the occurrences of each word and returning a Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>>. The first element of the pair is the total number of words, and the second is a map where keys are words and values are their counts. 3. Sorting Words: The sort method takes the map of word counts and sorts them by frequency in descending order, returning an ArrayList<String>.\n\nOutput Stage\n\nThe output stage displays the results to the user. This includes: - The total number of words. - A sorted list of words with their frequencies.\n\nHere is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the data flow:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[User Input] --> B[App.java - main]; B --> C[CountYourWords.java - readFile]; C --> D{File Read}; D -- Success --> E[ArrayList<String> fileLines]; D -- Failure --> F[Exception Handling]; E --> G[CountYourWords.java - count]; G --> H{Word Counting}; H -- Success --> I[Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> wordTotalCount]; H -- Failure --> J[Exception Handling]; I --> K[CountYourWords.java - sort]; K --> L{Sorting Words}; L -- Success --> M[ArrayList<String> finaList]; L -- Failure --> N[Exception Handling]; M --> O[Output Results to User];\n\nSummary\n\nThe data flow in CountYourWords is a straightforward process that involves reading a file, counting words, sorting them by frequency, and displaying the results. Each stage is clearly defined and handled by specific methods within the project. This design ensures modularity, testability, and maintainability of the system.",

        "page_content": "Text Analysis Text Analysis CountYourWords provides robust text analysis capabilities to help users understand and extract meaningful information from textual data. This section delves into the features related to analyzing text, such as frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction. Frequency Analysis Frequency analysis is a fundamental technique used to determine how often each word appears in a given text. CountYourWords uses this feature to provide insights into the distribution of words within a document. The following code snippet demonstrates how frequency analysis can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class FrequencyAnalyzer { public static Map for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } return wordCount; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\"; Map<String, Integer> frequencyMap = analyzeFrequency(text); System.out.println(frequencyMap); } } ``` Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. CountYourWords utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis. The following code snippet illustrates how sentiment analysis can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class SentimentAnalyzer { private static final Map static { sentimentScores.put(\"happy\", 1); sentimentScores.put(\"sad\", -1); sentimentScores.put(\"angry\", -2); sentimentScores.put(\"excited\", 2); } public static int analyzeSentiment(String text) { String[] words = text.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\"); int sentimentScore = 0; for (String word : words) { if (sentimentScores.containsKey(word)) { sentimentScore += sentimentScores.get(word); } } return sentimentScore; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"I am very happy today. The weather is beautiful.\"; int sentiment = analyzeSentiment(text); System.out.println(\"Sentiment Score: \" + sentiment); } } ``` Keyword Extraction Keyword extraction involves identifying the most important words or phrases in a piece of text. CountYourWords uses techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract keywords. The following code snippet demonstrates how keyword extraction can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class KeywordExtractor { public static Map for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } double totalWords = wordCount.size(); Map<String, Double> keywordScores = new HashMap<>(); for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) { String word = entry.getKey(); int count = entry.getValue(); double score = (count / totalWords) * Math.log(totalWords / 1.0); // Simplified TF-IDF keywordScores.put(word, score); } return keywordScores; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\"; Map<String, Double> keywords = extractKeywords(text); System.out.println(keywords); } } ```",

        "page_content": "Frameworks and Libraries Frameworks and Libraries The CountYourWords project relies on several frameworks and libraries to facilitate its development. These tools enhance various aspects of the application, from testing and assertions to sorting algorithms. Hamcrest Core (hamcrest-core-1.3.jar) Purpose: Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects in Java. It provides a more readable way to assert conditions in tests compared to traditional JUnit assertions. Role: This library is used extensively for creating custom matchers in the test suite, making it easier to write expressive and maintainable test cases. JUnit (junit-4.13.2.jar) Purpose: JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java applications. It allows developers to write repeatable tests that validate their code. Role: The CountYourWords project uses JUnit to create unit tests for its core functionality, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under various conditions. Custom Libraries and Classes In addition to external libraries, the CountYourWords project includes several custom classes and utilities: Pair Class (src/main/Pair.java) Purpose: The Pair class is a simple utility class used to store two related objects together. It is particularly useful in sorting algorithms where pairs of words and their counts need to be maintained. Role: This class simplifies the handling of word-count pairs, making the code more readable and maintainable. Sort Class (src/main/Sort.java) Purpose: The Sort class contains various sorting algorithms. Currently, it includes an insertion sort implementation, which is used to sort words alphabetically before counting their occurrences. Role: This class encapsulates the logic for sorting operations, ensuring that the main application logic remains clean and focused on word processing. Example Code Snippets Below are some example code snippets demonstrating the use of these frameworks and libraries: Hamcrest Matcher Example (src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java) ```java import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo; public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { // Arrange String input = \"hello world hello\"; CountYourWords countYourWords = new CountYourWords(); // Act Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = countYourWords.countWords(input); // Assert assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"hello\"), equalTo(2)); assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"world\"), equalTo(1)); } } ```",

The primary components of the user interface include: Console Input/Output The application reads input from a fixed file named input.txt located in the project directory. The output is displayed directly in the console, showing the total number of words and their occurrences. Code Example: ```java // Main class to read input and display results public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) { HashMap private static void processLine(String line, HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) { String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { word = word.toLowerCase(); wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } } } ``` File Handling The application handles file reading and writing operations. It reads from input.txt and writes the results to the console. Code Example: ```java // Utility class for file handling public class FileUtils { public static String readFile(String filePath) throws IOException { StringBuilder content = new StringBuilder(); try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { content.append(line).append(\"\\n\"); } } return content.toString(); } public static void writeFile(String filePath, String content) throws IOException { try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath))) { writer.write(content); } } } ``` Sorting Algorithm The application includes a custom sorting algorithm to sort the words alphabetically. This algorithm is implemented in the Sort class. Code Example: ```java // Custom sorting algorithm public class Sort { public static ArrayList // Now to add the values back for (String word : sortedWords) { String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word)); String fString = word + \" \" + value; sortedWordCounts.add(fString); } return sortedWordCounts; } private static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) { ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array)); for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) { String key = list.get(i); int j = i - 1; while (j >= 0 && list.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) { list.set(j + 1, list.get(j)); j--; } list.set(j + 1, key); } return list; } } ```",

The project adheres to specific constraints, including ignoring numbers, special characters, and case sensitivity. The goal of the project is to produce production-ready code with comprehensive testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Additionally, the application must be designed following SOLID principles and object-oriented programming practices. Project Structure The CountYourWords project has a structured file tree as follows: CountYourWords/ ├── lib/ │ ├── hamcrest-core-1.3.jar │ └── junit-4.13.2.jar ├── readme.md ├── src/ │ ├── main/ │ │ ├── App.java │ │ ├── CountYourWords.java │ │ ├── Pair.java │ │ └── Sort.java │ └── test/ │ ├── CountYourWordsTest.java │ ├── SortTest.java │ └── textTests/ │ ├── emptyFile.txt │ ├── exampleFile.txt │ ├── nonPeriodFile.txt │ └── validFile.txt Key Components 1. readme.md This file provides a detailed overview of the project, including its description, constraints, and goals. It serves as the primary documentation for developers. Example Content: ```markdown Project Description I am creating a text parser in Java named CountYourWords. Constraints Numbers in the document are ignored and are not processed Other characters than words should be filtered out of the input, so ## or @ or !! are ignored You do not have to take in account strange combinations like: love4u or mail@address.nl, combinations like these are out of scope for this assignment Next to showing the total number of words in the document, the number of occurrences of each word is also calculated The total number of occurrences next to the word must be shown on screen one by one (in lowercase) Counting the occurrences per word is case insensitive (so Matchbox, matchbox, and MATCHBOX are all the same word) When printing the occurrences, the words must be in alphabetical order You cannot use a built-in .NET sort routine, so produce on of your own, it does not have to be the fastest sort-routine as long as it is reliable end reusable. The document is a text file that will be read by your console app and has the fixed name: input.txt Goal The code must be production code, use everything you would use in production. You are allowed to use third party components if required (except for the sorting) All classes can be in one .NET core console application (assembly), as long as you show clear separation Everything must be done using testing and TDD Use SOLID and object-oriented programming ```",

These integration points are crucial for understanding how various parts of the system interact with each other and with external resources. Internal Component Integration The primary internal component in CountYourWords is the CountYourWords class, which handles the main logic for counting words in a text file. This class interacts with several other components: Pair Class: The Pair class is used to store and return results from word count operations. It encapsulates two values: a total count of words and a HashMap mapping each word to its frequency. ```java public final class Pair { private final int totalCount; private final HashMap public Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) { this.totalCount = first; this.wordCounts = second; } public int getFirst() { return totalCount; } public HashMap<String, Integer> getSecond() { return wordCounts; } } ``` Sort Class: The Sort class is responsible for sorting the results based on word frequency. It takes a Pair object as input and returns a sorted list of words. java public class Sort { public List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> sort(Pair pair) { List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entries = new ArrayList<>(pair.getSecond().entrySet()); Collections.sort(entries, (e1, e2) -> e2.getValue().compareTo(e1.getValue())); return entries; } } External System Integration CountYourWords interacts with external systems primarily through file operations. The project includes several test files located in the src/test/textTests directory: emptyFile.txt: An empty file used to test edge cases. exampleFile.txt: A sample text file containing words for word count. nonPeriodFile.txt: A file without periods, which might affect word separation logic. validFile.txt: A valid text file with proper formatting. These files are read by the CountYourWords class to perform word counting operations. The project also includes test cases in the src/test/java/CountYourWordsTest.java and src/test/java/SortTest.java files, which utilize these external resources to validate the functionality of the system.",

This process involves several key steps, including tokenization, normalization, and counting. Below, we will delve into the details of how these steps are implemented within the system. Tokenization Tokenization is the first step in word counting. It involves breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords system uses a simple regular expression to identify words: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> tokenize(String text) { return Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\W+\")); } This method splits the input text using any non-word character (\\\\W+) as the delimiter. The resulting list of tokens is then returned.  Counting Word Counting The CountYourWords system is designed to count words in a given text input.

Tokenization Tokenization is the first step in word counting. It involves breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords system uses a simple regular expression to identify words: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> tokenize(String text) { return Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\W+\")); } This method splits the input text using any non-word character (\\\\W+) as the delimiter. The resulting list of tokens is then returned. Normalization Normalization involves converting all words to a consistent case (typically lowercase) to ensure that word counts are case-insensitive. This step helps in accurately counting occurrences of the same word regardless of its case: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> normalize(List<String> tokens) { return tokens.stream() .map(String::toLowerCase) .collect(Collectors.toList()); } The normalize method takes a list of tokens and converts each token to lowercase using the String.toLowerCase() method. The resulting normalized list is then returned. Counting The counting step involves iterating over the normalized list of words and keeping track of their occurrences. This can be efficiently done using a HashMap: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static Map<String, Integer> count(List<String> tokens) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String token : tokens) { wordCounts.put(token, wordCounts.getOrDefault(token, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; } The count method takes a list of normalized tokens and iterates over each token. For each token, it updates the count in the wordCounts map using the getOrDefault method to handle cases where the token is not yet present in the map.",

        "page_content": "Edge Cases Handling edge cases is crucial for robust word counting. Some common edge cases include: Empty Input: If the input text is empty, the system should return a count of 0. Punctuation: Punctuation marks should be ignored when counting words. For example, \"hello,\" and \"hello\" should both be counted as \"hello\". Case Insensitivity: The word counting should be case-insensitive, so \"Hello\" and \"hello\" should be treated as the same word. The provided test cases in CountYourWordsTest.java cover these edge cases: ```java // src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList assertEquals(0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty()); @Test public void testPunctuation() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(5, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"welcome\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"to\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(4, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } ``` These test cases ensure that the word counting system handles various edge cases correctly. Performance Considerations For large text inputs, performance can be a concern. The current implementation uses a simple HashMap for counting, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups. However, for very large inputs, this could become a bottleneck. To improve performance, the system could use more advanced data structures or parallel processing techniques. For example, using a concurrent hash map (ConcurrentHashMap) or distributing the counting task across multiple threads could help handle larger inputs more efficiently. Conclusion The CountYourWords system provides a robust solution for counting words in text input. By breaking down the process into tokenization, normalization, and counting, the system ensures accurate word counts while handling various edge cases. The provided test cases validate the correctness of the implementation, and further performance optimizations can be considered for larger inputs.

        "page_content": "Key Features Key Features CountYourWords is designed to provide a robust text processing solution with several key features: Word Counting One of the primary functionalities of CountYourWords is its ability to count words in a given text file. This feature ensures that each word's occurrence is accurately recorded, regardless of case sensitivity. Example Code: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String line : fileLines) { String[] words = line.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } } return new Pair<>(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts); } } Text Analysis CountYourWords also includes a text analysis feature that sorts the words based on their frequency. This helps in understanding which words are most common in the text. Example Code: ```java // src/main/Sort.java public class Sort { public static ArrayList ArrayList<String> sortedArray = new ArrayList<>(); for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) { sortedArray.add(entry.getKey() + \" \" + entry.getValue()); } return sortedArray; } } ``` User Interface Features While the primary focus is on backend functionality, CountYourWords also includes a simple user interface to interact with the application. This feature allows users to input file paths and view word counts and their occurrences. Example Code: ```java // src/main/App.java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length == 0) { System.out.println(\"Please provide a file path as an argument.\"); return; } String filePath = args[0]; try { ArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(filePath); Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); ArrayList<String> sortedArray = Sort.sort(result.getSecond()); System.out.println(\"Total words: \" + result.getFirst()); for (String entry : sortedArray) { System.out.println(entry); } } catch (IOException e) { System.err.println(\"Error reading file: \" + e.getMessage()); } } private static ArrayList<String> readFile(String filePath) throws IOException { ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>(); try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { lines.add(line); } } return lines; } } ```",

        "page_content": "Primary Goal Primary Goal The primary goal of CountYourWords is to develop a robust text parser that processes input from a file named input.txt and outputs the total number of words along with their individual occurrences. This project aims to adhere to several key constraints and objectives: Input Processing: The application reads from input.txt, which contains text data. Numbers, special characters, and case sensitivity are ignored during processing. Output Requirements: The total number of words in the document is displayed. Each word's occurrence count is shown on the screen, sorted alphabetically. Word counts are case insensitive (e.g., \"Matchbox\", \"matchbox\", and \"MATCHBOX\" are treated as the same word). Code Quality: The code must be production-ready, using best practices in object-oriented programming and design patterns such as SOLID principles. Testing and TDD (Test-Driven Development) methodologies are strictly enforced to ensure code quality and reliability. Implementation Details: All classes can be contained within a single .NET Core console application. A custom sorting algorithm must be implemented, as built-in sort routines are not allowed. Dependencies: Third-party components may be used except for the sorting functionality, which must be implemented in-house. Example Usage The application processes input.txt and outputs results based on the specified rules. For example, if input.txt contains: Hello world This is a test. World of Java! The output might be: Total words: 9 hello 1 is 1 java 1 of 1 test 1 this 1 world 2 Code Snippets Below are snippets from the CountYourWords project that demonstrate key components of the implementation.

This section outlines the key security measures in place, including authentication, authorization, and data encryption. Authentication Authentication is the process of verifying a user's identity before granting them access to the system. In CountYourWords, authentication is handled using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). When a user logs in, they provide their credentials, which are verified against the stored credentials. If the credentials are valid, a JWT is issued and returned to the client. java // Example of JWT generation in Java String token = Jwts.builder() .setSubject(user.getUsername()) .setIssuedAt(new Date()) .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000)) // 1 day validity .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, \"secretKey\") .compact(); The JWT is then used in subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The server verifies the token's signature and expiration before granting access. Authorization Authorization is the process of determining what actions a user can perform within the system. In CountYourWords, authorization is enforced using Spring Security. Each endpoint has associated roles that determine which users are allowed to access it. ```java // Example of securing an endpoint in Spring Security @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/api\") public class WordController { @GetMapping(\"/words\") @PreAuthorize(\"hasRole('USER')\") public List<String> getWords() { // Endpoint logic here } } ``` In this example, the /api/words endpoint is accessible only to users with the USER role. Data Encryption Data encryption is used to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit. In CountYourWords, data is encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) when stored in the database. Additionally, all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS. java // Example of encrypting data using AES in Java public byte[] encrypt(byte[] data, SecretKey secretKey) throws Exception { Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\"); cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey); return cipher.doFinal(data); } The encryption key is securely stored and managed to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt the data.",

        "page_content": "Data Flow Data Flow The data flow in the CountYourWords project is designed to handle the processing of text files, counting words, and sorting them. The system follows a clear sequence from input to output, ensuring that each stage is well-defined and easily testable. Input Stage The input stage begins with the user providing a file path through the console. This is handled by the main method in the App.java class: ```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in)); System.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \"); // Reading File name String path = \"\"; try { path = br.readLine(); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path); Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); ArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond()); System.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst()); for (String line : finaList) { System.out.println(line); } } ``` Processing Stage The processing stage involves three main steps: 1. Reading the File: The readFile method in the CountYourWords.java class reads the file specified by the user and returns an ArrayList<String> containing each line of the file. 2. Counting Words: The count method processes the list of lines, counting the occurrences of each word and returning a Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>>. The first element of the pair is the total number of words, and the second is a map where keys are words and values are their counts. 3. Sorting Words: The sort method takes the map of word counts and sorts them by frequency in descending order, returning an ArrayList<String>. Output Stage The output stage displays the results to the user. This includes: - The total number of words. - A sorted list of words with their frequencies. Here is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the data flow: mermaid graph TD; A[User Input] --> B[App.java - main]; B --> C[CountYourWords.java - readFile]; C --> D{File Read}; D -- Success --> E[ArrayList<String> fileLines]; D -- Failure --> F[Exception Handling]; E --> G[CountYourWords.java - count]; G --> H{Word Counting}; H -- Success --> I[Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> wordTotalCount]; H -- Failure --> J[Exception Handling]; I --> K[CountYourWords.java - sort]; K --> L{Sorting Words}; L -- Success --> M[ArrayList<String> finaList]; L -- Failure --> N[Exception Handling]; M --> O[Output Results to User];",

        "page_content": "Programming Languages Programming Languages CountYourWords is developed using Java, a robust and widely-used programming language known for its portability, performance, and extensive library support. Below are the details of the specific versions and features utilized in CountYourWords. Java Version CountYourWords is built on Java version 11 (JDK 11). This version was chosen for its balance between performance, security, and feature set, making it suitable for both development and production environments. java // Example of setting the Java version in a build tool like Maven <properties> <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source> <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target> </properties> Key Libraries and Dependencies Hamcrest Core (Version 1.3) Hamcrest is used for writing readable assertions in tests. It provides a more expressive way to write test cases compared to traditional JUnit assertions. ```java // Example of using Hamcrest in a test case import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo; @Test public void testSingleLine() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertThat(result.getFirst(), equalTo(2)); } ``` JUnit 4 (Version 4.13.2) JUnit is the de-facto standard for writing repeatable tests in Java. It provides a simple and flexible framework to create and run tests. ```java // Example of a JUnit test class import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals; public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList assertEquals(0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty()); } } ``` Programming Language Features Utilized Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) CountYourWords is designed using OOP principles. It includes classes such as CountYourWords, Sort, and Pair to encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability. ```java // Example of a simple class in CountYourWords public class CountYourWords { public static Pair count(ArrayList public static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) { // Implementation details } } ``` Generics Generics are used extensively to ensure type safety and reduce the need for casting. ```java // Example of using generics in CountYourWords public class Pair public Pair(T first, R second) { this.first = first; this.second = second; } // Getters and setters } ```",

This section delves into the features related to analyzing text, such as frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction.\n\nFrequency Analysis\n\nFrequency analysis is a fundamental technique used to determine how often each word appears in a given text. CountYourWords uses this feature to provide insights into the distribution of words within a document. The following code snippet demonstrates how frequency analysis can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class FrequencyAnalyzer { public static Map\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return wordCount;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\";\n    Map<String, Integer> frequencyMap = analyzeFrequency(text);\n    System.out.println(frequencyMap);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSentiment Analysis\n\nSentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. CountYourWords utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis. The following code snippet illustrates how sentiment analysis can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class SentimentAnalyzer { private static final Map\n\nstatic {\n    sentimentScores.put(\"happy\", 1);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"sad\", -1);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"angry\", -2);\n    sentimentScores.put(\"excited\", 2);\n}\n\npublic static int analyzeSentiment(String text) {\n    String[] words = text.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\");\n    int sentimentScore = 0;\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (sentimentScores.containsKey(word)) {\n            sentimentScore += sentimentScores.get(word);\n        }\n    }\n\n    return sentimentScore;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"I am very happy today. The weather is beautiful.\";\n    int sentiment = analyzeSentiment(text);\n    System.out.println(\"Sentiment Score: \" + sentiment);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nKeyword Extraction\n\nKeyword extraction involves identifying the most important words or phrases in a piece of text. CountYourWords uses techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract keywords. The following code snippet demonstrates how keyword extraction can be implemented:\n\n```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map;\n\npublic class KeywordExtractor { public static Map\n\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n\n    double totalWords = wordCount.size();\n    Map<String, Double> keywordScores = new HashMap<>();\n\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) {\n        String word = entry.getKey();\n        int count = entry.getValue();\n        double score = (count / totalWords) * Math.log(totalWords / 1.0); // Simplified TF-IDF\n        keywordScores.put(word, score);\n    }\n\n    return keywordScores;\n}\n\npublic static void main(String[] args) {\n    String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\";\n    Map<String, Double> keywords = extractKeywords(text);\n    System.out.println(keywords);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nTools and Libraries\n\nCountYourWords leverages several tools and libraries to enhance its text analysis capabilities:\n\nJava Collections Framework: Used for data structures like HashMap to store word counts.\n\nJUnit: For unit testing the text analysis features, ensuring they work as expected.\n\nHamcrest Core: Provides matchers for assertions in JUnit tests.\n\nThese tools and libraries help ensure that CountYourWords is both efficient and reliable in its text analysis tasks.",

This section delves into the features related to analyzing text, such as frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction. Frequency Analysis Frequency analysis is a fundamental technique used to determine how often each word appears in a given text. CountYourWords uses this feature to provide insights into the distribution of words within a document. The following code snippet demonstrates how frequency analysis can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class FrequencyAnalyzer { public static Map for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } return wordCount; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\"; Map<String, Integer> frequencyMap = analyzeFrequency(text); System.out.println(frequencyMap); } } ``` Sentiment Analysis Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotional tone behind a piece of text. CountYourWords utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to perform sentiment analysis. The following code snippet illustrates how sentiment analysis can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class SentimentAnalyzer { private static final Map static { sentimentScores.put(\"happy\", 1); sentimentScores.put(\"sad\", -1); sentimentScores.put(\"angry\", -2); sentimentScores.put(\"excited\", 2); } public static int analyzeSentiment(String text) { String[] words = text.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\"); int sentimentScore = 0; for (String word : words) { if (sentimentScores.containsKey(word)) { sentimentScore += sentimentScores.get(word); } } return sentimentScore; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"I am very happy today. The weather is beautiful.\"; int sentiment = analyzeSentiment(text); System.out.println(\"Sentiment Score: \" + sentiment); } } ``` Keyword Extraction Keyword extraction involves identifying the most important words or phrases in a piece of text. CountYourWords uses techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract keywords. The following code snippet demonstrates how keyword extraction can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class KeywordExtractor { public static Map for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } double totalWords = wordCount.size(); Map<String, Double> keywordScores = new HashMap<>(); for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) { String word = entry.getKey(); int count = entry.getValue(); double score = (count / totalWords) * Math.log(totalWords / 1.0); // Simplified TF-IDF keywordScores.put(word, score); } return keywordScores; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\"; Map<String, Double> keywords = extractKeywords(text); System.out.println(keywords); } } ```",

The output is displayed directly in the console, showing the total number of words and their occurrences.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Main class to read input and display results public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) { HashMap\n\nprivate static void processLine(String line, HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\");\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            word = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nFile Handling\n\nThe application handles file reading and writing operations. It reads from input.txt and writes the results to the console.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Utility class for file handling public class FileUtils { public static String readFile(String filePath) throws IOException { StringBuilder content = new StringBuilder(); try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) { content.append(line).append(\"\\n\"); } } return content.toString(); }\n\npublic static void writeFile(String filePath, String content) throws IOException {\n    try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filePath))) {\n        writer.write(content);\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSorting Algorithm\n\nThe application includes a custom sorting algorithm to sort the words alphabetically. This algorithm is implemented in the Sort class.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Custom sorting algorithm public class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    // Now to add the values back\n    for (String word : sortedWords) {\n        String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word));\n        String fString = word + \" \" + value;\n        sortedWordCounts.add(fString);\n    }\n\n    return sortedWordCounts;\n}\n\nprivate static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) {\n    ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array));\n    for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) {\n        String key = list.get(i);\n        int j = i - 1;\n        while (j >= 0 && list.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) {\n            list.set(j + 1, list.get(j));\n            j--;\n        }\n        list.set(j + 1, key);\n    }\n    return list;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nError Handling\n\nThe application includes basic error handling to manage file reading and processing errors.\n\nCode Example:\n\n```java // Main class with error handling public class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(\"input.txt\"))) { HashMap\n\nprivate static void processLine(String line, HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\");\n    for (String word : words) {\n        if (!word.isEmpty()) {\n            word = word.toLowerCase();\n            wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSummary\n\nThe user interface of CountYourWords is designed to be simple and straightforward. It reads input from a fixed file, processes the text using custom logic, sorts the results alphabetically, and outputs them directly to the console. The application includes basic error handling to manage file reading errors.\n\nThis section provides an overview of the key components and their interactions within the CountYourWords user interface.",

The project adheres to specific constraints, including ignoring numbers, special characters, and case sensitivity. The goal of the project is to produce production-ready code with comprehensive testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD). Additionally, the application must be designed following SOLID principles and object-oriented programming practices.\n\nProject Structure\n\nThe CountYourWords project has a structured file tree as follows:\n\nCountYourWords/ ├── lib/ │ ├── hamcrest-core-1.3.jar │ └── junit-4.13.2.jar ├── readme.md ├── src/ │ ├── main/ │ │ ├── App.java │ │ ├── CountYourWords.java │ │ ├── Pair.java │ │ └── Sort.java │ └── test/ │ ├── CountYourWordsTest.java │ ├── SortTest.java │ └── textTests/ │ ├── emptyFile.txt │ ├── exampleFile.txt │ ├── nonPeriodFile.txt │ └── validFile.txt\n\nKey Components\n\n1. readme.md\n\nThis file provides a detailed overview of the project, including its description, constraints, and goals. It serves as the primary documentation for developers.\n\nExample Content: ```markdown\n\nProject Description\n\nI am creating a text parser in Java named CountYourWords.\n\nConstraints\n\nNumbers in the document are ignored and are not processed\n\nOther characters than words should be filtered out of the input, so ## or @ or !! are ignored\n\nYou do not have to take in account strange combinations like: love4u or mail@address.nl, combinations like these are out of scope for this assignment\n\nNext to showing the total number of words in the document, the number of occurrences of each word is also calculated\n\nThe total number of occurrences next to the word must be shown on screen one by one (in lowercase)\n\nCounting the occurrences per word is case insensitive (so Matchbox, matchbox, and MATCHBOX are all the same word)\n\nWhen printing the occurrences, the words must be in alphabetical order\n\nYou cannot use a built-in .NET sort routine, so produce on of your own, it does not have to be the fastest sort-routine as long as it is reliable end reusable.\n\nThe document is a text file that will be read by your console app and has the fixed name: input.txt\n\nGoal\n\nThe code must be production code, use everything you would use in production. You are allowed to use third party components if required (except for the sorting)\n\nAll classes can be in one .NET core console application (assembly), as long as you show clear separation\n\nEverything must be done using testing and TDD\n\nUse SOLID and object-oriented programming ```\n\n2. CountYourWords.java\n\nThis is the main class of the project, responsible for orchestrating the word counting process.\n\nExample Code: ```java import java.io.BufferedReader; import java.io.FileReader; import java.io.IOException; import java.util.HashMap;\n\npublic class CountYourWords { public static void main(String[] args) { String fileName = \"input.txt\"; HashMap\n\n    try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(fileName))) {\n        String line;\n        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {\n            String[] words = line.split(\"\\\\W+\");\n            for (String word : words) {\n                if (!word.isEmpty() && !Character.isDigit(word.charAt(0))) {\n                    wordCounts.put(word.toLowerCase(), wordCounts.getOrDefault(word.toLowerCase(), 0) + 1);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n\n        ArrayList<String> sortedWordCounts = Sort.sort(wordCounts);\n        for (String entry : sortedWordCounts) {\n            System.out.println(entry);\n        }\n    } catch (IOException e) {\n        e.printStackTrace();\n    }\n}\n\n} ```\n\n3. Sort.java\n\nThis class contains a method to sort the word counts alphabetically.\n\nExample Code: ```java import java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\npublic static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {\n    ArrayList<String> sortedWordCounts = new ArrayList<>();\n    // Sort the words first\n    ArrayList<String> sortedWords = insertionSort(wordCounts.keySet().toArray(new String[0]));\n\n    // Now to add the values back\n    for (String word : sortedWords) {\n        String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word));\n        String fString = word + \" \" + value;\n        sortedWordCounts.add(fString);\n    }\n\n    return sortedWordCounts;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships and dependencies within the CountYourWords project:\n\nmermaid graph TD A[CountYourWords.java] --> B(App.java) A --> C(CountYourWords.java) A --> D(Sort.java) B --> E(CountYourWords.java) C --> F(Sort.java) D --> G(Sort.java)\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project is a comprehensive text parser that processes an input file to count words and their occurrences. It adheres to specific constraints, uses TDD for development, and follows SOLID principles. The project structure includes essential files such as readme.md, CountYourWords.java, and Sort.java.

The project adheres to specific constraints, such as ignoring numbers, special characters, and case sensitivity. Below is an overview of the major components and their interactions within the CountYourWords project. Key Components Input Handling File Reading: The application reads from input.txt using standard Java file handling mechanisms. Source File: src/main/App.java java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { // Code to read input.txt and process the text } } Text Processing Word Tokenization: The text is tokenized into individual words, ignoring numbers and special characters. Source File: src/main/CountYourWords.java java public class CountYourWords { public static HashMap<String, Integer> processText(String input) { // Code to tokenize the input and count word occurrences } } Sorting Custom Sorting Algorithm: A custom insertion sort algorithm is implemented to sort words alphabetically. Source File: src/main/Sort.java java public class Sort { public static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) { // Code for insertion sort } } Output Formatted Output: The sorted word counts are formatted and printed to the console. Source File: src/main/App.java java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { // Code to read input.txt, process text, sort, and print results } } Testing Unit Tests: JUnit tests are provided to ensure the correctness of each component. Source File: src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java ```java import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.*; public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testProcessText() { // Test cases for processText method } } ``` Component Interactions The major components interact as follows: App.java Reads input.txt. Calls CountYourWords.processText() to count word occurrences. Calls Sort.insertionSort() to sort the words alphabetically. Prints the sorted word counts. CountYourWords.java Tokenizes the input text into individual words. Counts the occurrences of each word, ignoring case sensitivity and numbers. Sort.java Implements a custom insertion sort algorithm to sort words alphabetically.",

          "page_content": "Integration Points\n\nIntegration Points\n\nIn this section, we will identify and describe any integration points between different components or external systems within the CountYourWords project. These integration points are crucial for understanding how various parts of the system interact with each other and with external resources.\n\nInternal Component Integration\n\nThe primary internal component in CountYourWords is the CountYourWords class, which handles the main logic for counting words in a text file. This class interacts with several other components:\n\nPair Class: The Pair class is used to store and return results from word count operations. It encapsulates two values: a total count of words and a HashMap mapping each word to its frequency.\n\n```java public final class Pair { private final int totalCount; private final HashMap\n\n   public Pair(int first, HashMap<String, Integer> second) {\n       this.totalCount = first;\n       this.wordCounts = second;\n   }\n\n   public int getFirst() {\n       return totalCount;\n   }\n\n   public HashMap<String, Integer> getSecond() {\n       return wordCounts;\n   }\n\n} ```\n\nSort Class: The Sort class is responsible for sorting the results based on word frequency. It takes a Pair object as input and returns a sorted list of words.\n\njava public class Sort { public List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> sort(Pair pair) { List<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> entries = new ArrayList<>(pair.getSecond().entrySet()); Collections.sort(entries, (e1, e2) -> e2.getValue().compareTo(e1.getValue())); return entries; } }\n\nExternal System Integration\n\nCountYourWords interacts with external systems primarily through file operations. The project includes several test files located in the src/test/textTests directory:\n\nemptyFile.txt: An empty file used to test edge cases.\n\nexampleFile.txt: A sample text file containing words for word count.\n\nnonPeriodFile.txt: A file without periods, which might affect word separation logic.\n\nvalidFile.txt: A valid text file with proper formatting.\n\nThese files are read by the CountYourWords class to perform word counting operations. The project also includes test cases in the src/test/java/CountYourWordsTest.java and src/test/java/SortTest.java files, which utilize these external resources to validate the functionality of the system.\n\nIntegration Diagram\n\nTo better visualize the integration points within CountYourWords, a Mermaid diagram can be used:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[CountYourWords] --> B[Pair] A --> C[Sort] B --> D[Sort] C --> E[Test Cases] D --> F[Test Cases]\n\nThis diagram shows the flow of data and control within the CountYourWords system, highlighting how CountYourWords interacts with the Pair and Sort classes, as well as external test cases.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the integration points in CountYourWords are primarily internal component interactions (e.g., between CountYourWords, Pair, and Sort) and external system interactions (e.g., file operations for word counting).

          "page_content": "Word Counting\n\nWord Counting\n\nThe CountYourWords system is designed to count words in a given text input. This process involves several key steps, including tokenization, normalization, and counting. Below, we will delve into the details of how these steps are implemented within the system.\n\nTokenization\n\nTokenization is the first step in word counting. It involves breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords system uses a simple regular expression to identify words:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> tokenize(String text) { return Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\W+\")); }\n\nThis method splits the input text using any non-word character (\\\\W+) as the delimiter. The resulting list of tokens is then returned.\n\nNormalization\n\nNormalization involves converting all words to a consistent case (typically lowercase) to ensure that word counts are case-insensitive. This step helps in accurately counting occurrences of the same word regardless of its case:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> normalize(List<String> tokens) { return tokens.stream() .map(String::toLowerCase) .collect(Collectors.toList()); }\n\nThe normalize method takes a list of tokens and converts each token to lowercase using the String.toLowerCase() method. The resulting normalized list is then returned.\n\nCounting\n\nThe counting step involves iterating over the normalized list of words and keeping track of their occurrences. This can be efficiently done using a HashMap:\n\njava // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static Map<String, Integer> count(List<String> tokens) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String token : tokens) { wordCounts.put(token, wordCounts.getOrDefault(token, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; }\n\nThe count method takes a list of normalized tokens and iterates over each token. For each token, it updates the count in the wordCounts map using the getOrDefault method to handle cases where the token is not yet present in the map.\n\nEdge Cases\n\nHandling edge cases is crucial for robust word counting. Some common edge cases include:\n\nEmpty Input: If the input text is empty, the system should return a count of 0.\n\nPunctuation: Punctuation marks should be ignored when counting words. For example, \"hello,\" and \"hello\" should both be counted as \"hello\".\n\nCase Insensitivity: The word counting should be case-insensitive, so \"Hello\" and \"hello\" should be treated as the same word.\n\nThe provided test cases in CountYourWordsTest.java cover these edge cases:\n\n```java // src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList\n\nassertEquals(0, result.getFirst());\nassertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());\n\n@Test public void testPunctuation() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(5, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"welcome\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"to\", 1);\nexpectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n@Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList\n\nPair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\n\nassertEquals(4, result.getFirst());\n\nHashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();\nexpectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4);\n\nassertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());\n\n} ```\n\nThese test cases ensure that the word counting system handles various edge cases correctly.\n\nPerformance Considerations\n\nFor large text inputs, performance can be a concern. The current implementation uses a simple HashMap for counting, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups. However, for very large inputs, this could become a bottleneck.\n\nTo improve performance, the system could use more advanced data structures or parallel processing techniques. For example, using a concurrent hash map (ConcurrentHashMap) or distributing the counting task across multiple threads could help handle larger inputs more efficiently.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords system provides a robust solution for counting words in text input. By breaking down the process into tokenization, normalization, and counting, the system ensures accurate word counts while handling various edge cases. The provided test cases validate the correctness of the implementation, and further performance optimizations can be considered for larger inputs.\n\nFor more detailed information on the CountYourWords project, refer to the project's README file.",

          "page_content": "Edge Cases Handling edge cases is crucial for robust word counting. Some common edge cases include: Empty Input: If the input text is empty, the system should return a count of 0. Punctuation: Punctuation marks should be ignored when counting words. For example, \"hello,\" and \"hello\" should both be counted as \"hello\". Case Insensitivity: The word counting should be case-insensitive, so \"Hello\" and \"hello\" should be treated as the same word. The provided test cases in CountYourWordsTest.java cover these edge cases: ```java // src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList assertEquals(0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty()); @Test public void testPunctuation() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(5, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"hello\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"world\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"welcome\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"to\", 1); expectedCounts.put(\"java\", 1); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); @Test public void testCaseInsensitivity() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertEquals(4, result.getFirst()); HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>(); expectedCounts.put(\"apple\", 4); assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond()); } ``` These test cases ensure that the word counting system handles various edge cases correctly. Performance Considerations For large text inputs, performance can be a concern. The current implementation uses a simple HashMap for counting, which has an average time complexity of O(1) for insertions and lookups. However, for very large inputs, this could become a bottleneck. To improve performance, the system could use more advanced data structures or parallel processing techniques. For example, using a concurrent hash map (ConcurrentHashMap) or distributing the counting task across multiple threads could help handle larger inputs more efficiently. Conclusion The CountYourWords system provides a robust solution for counting words in text input. By breaking down the process into tokenization, normalization, and counting, the system ensures accurate word counts while handling various edge cases. The provided test cases validate the correctness of the implementation, and further performance optimizations can be considered for larger inputs.

This process involves several key steps, including tokenization, normalization, and counting. Below, we will delve into the details of how these steps are implemented within the system. Tokenization Tokenization is the first step in word counting. It involves breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The CountYourWords system uses a simple regular expression to identify words: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> tokenize(String text) { return Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\W+\")); } This method splits the input text using any non-word character (\\\\W+) as the delimiter. The resulting list of tokens is then returned.  Counting Word Counting The CountYourWords system is designed to count words in a given text input.

The CountYourWords system uses a simple regular expression to identify words: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> tokenize(String text) { return Arrays.asList(text.split(\"\\\\W+\")); } This method splits the input text using any non-word character (\\\\W+) as the delimiter. The resulting list of tokens is then returned. Normalization Normalization involves converting all words to a consistent case (typically lowercase) to ensure that word counts are case-insensitive. This step helps in accurately counting occurrences of the same word regardless of its case: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static List<String> normalize(List<String> tokens) { return tokens.stream() .map(String::toLowerCase) .collect(Collectors.toList()); } The normalize method takes a list of tokens and converts each token to lowercase using the String.toLowerCase() method. The resulting normalized list is then returned. Counting The counting step involves iterating over the normalized list of words and keeping track of their occurrences. This can be efficiently done using a HashMap: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public static Map<String, Integer> count(List<String> tokens) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String token : tokens) { wordCounts.put(token, wordCounts.getOrDefault(token, 0) + 1); } return wordCounts; } The count method takes a list of normalized tokens and iterates over each token. For each token, it updates the count in the wordCounts map using the getOrDefault method to handle cases where the token is not yet present in the map.",

          "page_content": "Key Features Key Features CountYourWords is designed to provide a robust text processing solution with several key features: Word Counting One of the primary functionalities of CountYourWords is its ability to count words in a given text file. This feature ensures that each word's occurrence is accurately recorded, regardless of case sensitivity. Example Code: java // src/main/CountYourWords.java public class CountYourWords { public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) { HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); for (String line : fileLines) { String[] words = line.toLowerCase().split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } } return new Pair<>(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts); } } Text Analysis CountYourWords also includes a text analysis feature that sorts the words based on their frequency. This helps in understanding which words are most common in the text. Example Code: ```java // src/main/Sort.java public class Sort { public static ArrayList ArrayList<String> sortedArray = new ArrayList<>(); for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : list) { sortedArray.add(entry.getKey() + \" \" + entry.getValue()); } return sortedArray; } } ``` User Interface Features While the primary focus is on backend functionality, CountYourWords also includes a simple user interface to interact with the application. This feature allows users to input file paths and view word counts and their occurrences. Example Code: ```java // src/main/App.java public class App { public static void main(String[] args) { if (args.length == 0) { System.out.println(\"Please provide a file path as an argument.\"); return; } String filePath = args[0]; try { ArrayList<String> fileLines = readFile(filePath); Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); ArrayList<String> sortedArray = Sort.sort(result.getSecond()); System.out.println(\"Total words: \" + result.getFirst()); for (String entry : sortedArray) { System.out.println(entry); } } catch (IOException e) { System.err.println(\"Error reading file: \" + e.getMessage()); } } private static ArrayList<String> readFile(String filePath) throws IOException { ArrayList<String> lines = new ArrayList<>(); try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filePath))) { String line; while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) { lines.add(line); } } return lines; } } ```",

If the credentials are valid, a JWT is issued and returned to the client.\n\njava // Example of JWT generation in Java String token = Jwts.builder() .setSubject(user.getUsername()) .setIssuedAt(new Date()) .setExpiration(new Date(System.currentTimeMillis() + 86400000)) // 1 day validity .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, \"secretKey\") .compact();\n\nThe JWT is then used in subsequent requests to authenticate the user. The server verifies the token's signature and expiration before granting access.\n\nAuthorization\n\nAuthorization is the process of determining what actions a user can perform within the system. In CountYourWords, authorization is enforced using Spring Security. Each endpoint has associated roles that determine which users are allowed to access it.\n\n```java // Example of securing an endpoint in Spring Security @RestController @RequestMapping(\"/api\") public class WordController {\n\n@GetMapping(\"/words\")\n@PreAuthorize(\"hasRole('USER')\")\npublic List<String> getWords() {\n    // Endpoint logic here\n}\n\n} ```\n\nIn this example, the /api/words endpoint is accessible only to users with the USER role.\n\nData Encryption\n\nData encryption is used to protect sensitive data both at rest and in transit. In CountYourWords, data is encrypted using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) when stored in the database. Additionally, all communication between the client and server is encrypted using HTTPS.\n\njava // Example of encrypting data using AES in Java public byte[] encrypt(byte[] data, SecretKey secretKey) throws Exception { Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(\"AES\"); cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secretKey); return cipher.doFinal(data); }\n\nThe encryption key is securely stored and managed to ensure that only authorized users can decrypt the data.\n\nSummary\n\nIn summary, CountYourWords employs a robust security architecture that includes authentication using JWTs, authorization using Spring Security roles, and data encryption using AES. These measures ensure that the system remains secure and protected against unauthorized access and data breaches.",

WordCounter.java\n\nPurpose: The WordCounter.java class counts the occurrences of each word in the input text, ignoring numbers and special characters.\n\njava public class WordCounter { public Map<String, Integer> countWords(String text) { Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>(); String[] words = text.split(\"\\\\W+\"); for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCounts.put(word.toLowerCase(), wordCounts.getOrDefault(word.toLowerCase(), 0) + 1); } } return wordCounts; } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/WordCounter.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n4. OutputFormatter.java\n\nPurpose: The OutputFormatter.java class formats the word counts for output, sorting them alphabetically and displaying each word with its count.\n\n```java public class OutputFormatter { public List\n\n    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : sortedWordCounts) {\n        System.out.println(entry.getKey() + \": \" + entry.getValue());\n    }\n    return sortedWordCounts;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/OutputFormatter.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n5. Sort.java\n\nPurpose: The Sort.java class contains a simple insertion sort algorithm to sort the words alphabetically.\n\njava public class Sort { public static ArrayList<String> insertionSort(String[] array) { ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(array)); for (int i = 1; i < list.size(); i++) { String key = list.get(i); int j = i - 1; while (j >= 0 && list.get(j).compareTo(key) > 0) { list.set(j + 1, list.get(j)); j--; } list.set(j + 1, key); } return list; } }\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/Sort.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n6. Pair.java\n\nPurpose: The Pair.java class is a utility class that holds pairs of values, which could be used in various parts of the system for storing related data.\n\n```java public class Pair\n\npublic Pair(K key, V value) {\n    this.key = key;\n    this.value = value;\n}\n\npublic K getKey() {\n    return key;\n}\n\npublic V getValue() {\n    return value;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/main/Pair.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\n7. Unit Tests\n\nThe project includes several unit tests to ensure the correctness of each component.\n\nCountYourWordsTest.java: Tests the functionality of the WordCounter and OutputFormatter classes.\n\nSortTest.java: Tests the sorting functionality in the Sort class.\n\nSources: - CountYourWords/src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here] - CountYourWords/src/test/SortTest.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\nThese tests utilize JUnit for assertions and Hamcrest for more expressive matchers.\n\n```java import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { WordCounter counter = new WordCounter(); String inputText = \"hello world hello\"; Map\n\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"hello\"), is(2));\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"world\"), is(1));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSource: CountYourWords/src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java, PK: [TODO: Insert specific PK detail here]\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the component interactions within the CountYourWords project:\n\nmermaid graph TD; App --> TextParser; App --> WordCounter; App --> OutputFormatter; TextParser --> WordCounter; WordCounter --> OutputFormatter; OutputFormatter --> App;\n\nThis diagram shows how data flows through the system, starting from reading the input file in App, parsing it in TextParser, counting words in WordCounter, and finally formatting and outputting the results in OutputFormatter.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project is designed with a clear separation of concerns, making each component responsible for a specific aspect of the system. This modular approach facilitates maintenance, testing, and scalability. The provided code snippets and diagrams should give you a comprehensive understanding of how each component works together to achieve the project's goal.",

The system follows a clear sequence from input to output, ensuring that each stage is well-defined and easily testable.\n\nInput Stage\n\nThe input stage begins with the user providing a file path through the console. This is handled by the main method in the App.java class:\n\n```java public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException { BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));\n\nSystem.out.print(\"Enter the Path : \");\n\n// Reading File name\nString path = \"\";\ntry {\n    path = br.readLine();\n} catch (IOException e) {\n    // TODO Auto-generated catch block\n    e.printStackTrace();\n}\n\nArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);\nPair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);\nArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond());\nSystem.out.printf(\"Number of words: %d\\n\", wordTotalCount.getFirst());\nfor (String line : finaList) {\n    System.out.println(line);\n}\n\n} ```\n\nProcessing Stage\n\nThe processing stage involves three main steps: 1. Reading the File: The readFile method in the CountYourWords.java class reads the file specified by the user and returns an ArrayList<String> containing each line of the file. 2. Counting Words: The count method processes the list of lines, counting the occurrences of each word and returning a Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>>. The first element of the pair is the total number of words, and the second is a map where keys are words and values are their counts. 3. Sorting Words: The sort method takes the map of word counts and sorts them by frequency in descending order, returning an ArrayList<String>.\n\nOutput Stage\n\nThe output stage displays the results to the user. This includes: - The total number of words. - A sorted list of words with their frequencies.\n\nHere is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the data flow:\n\nmermaid graph TD; A[User Input] --> B[App.java - main]; B --> C[CountYourWords.java - readFile]; C --> D{File Read}; D -- Success --> E[ArrayList<String> fileLines]; D -- Failure --> F[Exception Handling]; E --> G[CountYourWords.java - count]; G --> H{Word Counting}; H -- Success --> I[Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> wordTotalCount]; H -- Failure --> J[Exception Handling]; I --> K[CountYourWords.java - sort]; K --> L{Sorting Words}; L -- Success --> M[ArrayList<String> finaList]; L -- Failure --> N[Exception Handling]; M --> O[Output Results to User];\n\nSummary\n\nThe data flow in CountYourWords is a straightforward process that involves reading a file, counting words, sorting them by frequency, and displaying the results.

          "page_content": "Programming Languages Programming Languages CountYourWords is developed using Java, a robust and widely-used programming language known for its portability, performance, and extensive library support. Below are the details of the specific versions and features utilized in CountYourWords. Java Version CountYourWords is built on Java version 11 (JDK 11). This version was chosen for its balance between performance, security, and feature set, making it suitable for both development and production environments. java // Example of setting the Java version in a build tool like Maven <properties> <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source> <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target> </properties> Key Libraries and Dependencies Hamcrest Core (Version 1.3) Hamcrest is used for writing readable assertions in tests. It provides a more expressive way to write test cases compared to traditional JUnit assertions. ```java // Example of using Hamcrest in a test case import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo; @Test public void testSingleLine() { ArrayList Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines); assertThat(result.getFirst(), equalTo(2)); } ``` JUnit 4 (Version 4.13.2) JUnit is the de-facto standard for writing repeatable tests in Java. It provides a simple and flexible framework to create and run tests. ```java // Example of a JUnit test class import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals; public class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testEmptyFile() { ArrayList assertEquals(0, result.getFirst()); assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty()); } } ``` Programming Language Features Utilized Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) CountYourWords is designed using OOP principles. It includes classes such as CountYourWords, Sort, and Pair to encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability. ```java // Example of a simple class in CountYourWords public class CountYourWords { public static Pair count(ArrayList public static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) { // Implementation details } } ``` Generics Generics are used extensively to ensure type safety and reduce the need for casting. ```java // Example of using generics in CountYourWords public class Pair public Pair(T first, R second) { this.first = first; this.second = second; } // Getters and setters } ```",
