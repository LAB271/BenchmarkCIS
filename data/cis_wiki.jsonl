These tools enhance various aspects of the application, from testing and assertions to sorting algorithms.\n\nHamcrest Core (hamcrest-core-1.3.jar)\n\nPurpose: Hamcrest is a framework for writing matcher objects in Java. It provides a more readable way to assert conditions in tests compared to traditional JUnit assertions.\n\nRole: This library is used extensively for creating custom matchers in the test suite, making it easier to write expressive and maintainable test cases.\n\nJUnit (junit-4.13.2.jar)\n\nPurpose: JUnit is a widely-used testing framework for Java applications. It allows developers to write repeatable tests that validate their code.\n\nRole: The CountYourWords project uses JUnit to create unit tests for its core functionality, ensuring that the application behaves as expected under various conditions.\n\nCustom Libraries and Classes\n\nIn addition to external libraries, the CountYourWords project includes several custom classes and utilities:\n\nPair Class (src/main/Pair.java)\n\nPurpose: The Pair class is a simple utility class used to store two related objects together. It is particularly useful in sorting algorithms where pairs of words and their counts need to be maintained.\n\nRole: This class simplifies the handling of word-count pairs, making the code more readable and maintainable.\n\nSort Class (src/main/Sort.java)\n\nPurpose: The Sort class contains various sorting algorithms. Currently, it includes an insertion sort implementation, which is used to sort words alphabetically before counting their occurrences.\n\nRole: This class encapsulates the logic for sorting operations, ensuring that the main application logic remains clean and focused on word processing.\n\nExample Code Snippets\n\nBelow are some example code snippets demonstrating the use of these frameworks and libraries:\n\nHamcrest Matcher Example (src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java)\n\n```java import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { // Arrange String input = \"hello world hello\"; CountYourWords countYourWords = new CountYourWords();\n\n    // Act\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = countYourWords.countWords(input);\n\n    // Assert\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"hello\"), equalTo(2));\n    assertThat(wordCounts.get(\"world\"), equalTo(1));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nJUnit Test Example (src/test/CountYourWordsTest.java)\n\n```java import org.junit.Test; import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;\n\npublic class CountYourWordsTest { @Test public void testWordCount() { // Arrange String input = \"hello world hello\"; CountYourWords countYourWords = new CountYourWords();\n\n    // Act\n    Map<String, Integer> wordCounts = countYourWords.countWords(input);\n\n    // Assert\n    assertEquals(2, (int) wordCounts.get(\"hello\"));\n    assertEquals(1, (int) wordCounts.get(\"world\"));\n}\n\n} ```\n\nSort Algorithm Example (src/main/Sort.java)\n\n```java import java.util.ArrayList;\n\npublic class Sort { public static ArrayList\n\n    ArrayList<String> sortedList = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (String s : array) {\n        sortedList.add(s);\n    }\n    return sortedList;\n}\n\n} ```\n\nMermaid Diagram\n\nBelow is a Mermaid diagram illustrating the relationships between the main components of the CountYourWords project:\n\nmermaid graph TD A[CountYourWords.java] --> B[Sort.java] A --> C[Pair.java] B --> D[junit-4.13.2.jar] C --> E[hamcrest-core-1.3.jar]\n\nThis diagram shows how the main application class depends on sorting and utility classes, which in turn depend on testing and assertion libraries.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe CountYourWords project leverages several frameworks and libraries to enhance its development process.

The weather is beautiful.\"; int sentiment = analyzeSentiment(text); System.out.println(\"Sentiment Score: \" + sentiment); } } ``` Keyword Extraction Keyword extraction involves identifying the most important words or phrases in a piece of text. CountYourWords uses techniques such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to extract keywords. The following code snippet demonstrates how keyword extraction can be implemented: ```java import java.util.HashMap; import java.util.Map; public class KeywordExtractor { public static Map for (String word : words) { if (!word.isEmpty()) { wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1); } } double totalWords = wordCount.size(); Map<String, Double> keywordScores = new HashMap<>(); for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCount.entrySet()) { String word = entry.getKey(); int count = entry.getValue(); double score = (count / totalWords) * Math.log(totalWords / 1.0); // Simplified TF-IDF keywordScores.put(word, score); } return keywordScores; } public static void main(String[] args) { String text = \"The big brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. The quick brown fox.\"; Map<String, Double> keywords = extractKeywords(text); System.out.println(keywords); } } ```"], "reference": "CountYourWords provides robust text analysis capabilities, including frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, and keyword extraction. Frequency analysis determines how often each word appears in a text, sentiment analysis assesses the emotional tone behind the text using NLP techniques, and keyword extraction identifies important words or phrases using methods like TF-IDF.", "synthesizer_name": "single_hop_specifc_query_synthesizer"}
