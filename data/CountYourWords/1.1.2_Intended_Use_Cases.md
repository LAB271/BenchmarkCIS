# Intended Use Cases

### Intended Use Cases

CountYourWords is designed to be a versatile tool with numerous practical applications. Below are several scenarios where CountYourWords would be particularly useful:

#### Content Analysis
CountYourWords can be used to analyze text data, providing insights into the frequency and distribution of words within a given document. This feature is invaluable for content creators, SEO professionals, and researchers who need to understand the composition of their texts.

**Example Usage:**
```java
// Example code snippet from CountYourWords.java
public Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) {
    int totalWords = 0;
    HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>();

    for (String line : fileLines) {
        String[] words = line.split("\\s+");
        totalWords += words.length;

        for (String word : words) {
            word = word.toLowerCase();
            if (!word.isEmpty()) {
                wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
    }

    return new Pair<>(totalWords, wordCounts);
}
```

#### Data Validation
CountYourWords can be used to validate data by ensuring that it meets certain criteria. For instance, it can check if a text file contains only valid words and no numbers or special characters.

**Example Usage:**
```java
// Example code snippet from CountYourWordsTest.java
@Test
public void testInvalidFile() {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
    fileLines.add("Hello world 123"); // Contains a number

    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

    assertEquals(0, result.getFirst()); // Total words should be 0 due to invalid input
    assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty()); // Word counts map should be empty
}
```

#### Educational Tools
CountYourWords can serve as an educational tool for students learning about text processing and data analysis. It provides a practical application of concepts such as string manipulation, hashing, and sorting.

**Example Usage:**
```java
// Example code snippet from Sort.java
public static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {
    ArrayList<String> sortedArray = new ArrayList<>();
    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : wordCounts.entrySet()) {
        sortedArray.add(entry.getKey() + " " + entry.getValue());
    }
    Collections.sort(sortedArray);
    return sortedArray;
}
```

#### Real-Time Analytics
CountYourWords can be integrated into real-time analytics systems to monitor and analyze text data in near real-time. This is particularly useful for applications like chatbots, social media monitoring, and customer feedback analysis.

**Example Usage:**
```java
// Example code snippet from App.java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
    // Read lines from input.txt
    // ...

    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);
    System.out.println("Total words: " + result.getFirst());
    for (String entry : CountYourWords.sort(result.getSecond())) {
        System.out.println(entry);
    }
}
```

### Summary

CountYourWords offers a wide range of applications, from content analysis and data validation to educational tools and real-time analytics. Its flexibility and robustness make it a valuable tool for developers working with text data.
