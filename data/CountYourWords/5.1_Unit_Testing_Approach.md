# Unit Testing Approach

## Unit Testing Approach

### Overview of Unit Testing in CountYourWords

Unit testing is a critical component of the development process for CountYourWords. It ensures that individual units of code (methods, functions) work as expected before they are integrated into larger components. This approach helps catch bugs early and improves software quality.

### Tools Used for Unit Testing

CountYourWords uses JUnit 4.13.2 for unit testing. JUnit is a widely-used framework for writing repeatable tests in Java. It provides annotations to mark test methods, setup and teardown methods, and assertions to validate the correctness of the code.

#### Dependencies
- **JUnit**: Version 4.13.2

### Test Coverage Goals

The goal for unit testing in CountYourWords is to achieve a high level of code coverage. The target is at least 80% test coverage across all tested classes and methods. This ensures that most of the application's functionality is covered by tests, reducing the risk of bugs.

### Example Unit Tests

Below are examples of unit tests for key functionalities in CountYourWords.

#### Sorting Algorithm Test

The `sort` method sorts a map of word counts into an ordered list. The following test cases ensure that the sorting algorithm works correctly.

```java
@Test
public void sortEmptyTest() {
    HashMap<String, Integer> emptyMap = new HashMap<>();
    ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(emptyMap);
    assertTrue("Array should be empty", sortedArray.isEmpty());
}

@Test
public void sortSingleTest() {
    HashMap<String, Integer> singleMap = new HashMap<>();
    singleMap.put("apple", 1);
    ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(singleMap);
    ArrayList<String> returnString = new ArrayList<>();
    returnString.add("apple 1");
    assertEquals(returnString, sortedArray);
}

@Test
public void sortMultipleTest() {
    HashMap<String, Integer> multipleMap = new HashMap<>();
    multipleMap.put("cherry", 1);
    multipleMap.put("banana", 1);
    multipleMap.put("apple", 1);
    ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(multipleMap);

    List<String> expectedKeys = Arrays.asList("apple 1", "banana 1", "cherry 1");
    List<String> actualKeys = sortedArray;

    assertEquals("Keys should be sorted", expectedKeys, actualKeys);
}
```

#### Word Counting Test

The `count` method processes a list of file lines and returns the total word count along with a map of individual word counts. The following test cases ensure that the word counting logic is correct.

```java
@Test
public void testEmptyFile() {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

    assertEquals("Total words should be 0", 0, result.getFirst());
    assertTrue("Word counts map should be empty", result.getSecond().isEmpty());
}

@Test
public void testSingleLine() {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
    fileLines.add("Hello world");

    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

    assertEquals("Total words should be 2", 2, result.getFirst());

    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();
    expectedCounts.put("hello", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("world", 1);

    assertEquals("Word counts should match expected counts", expectedCounts, result.getSecond());
}

@Test
public void testMultipleLines() {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
    fileLines.add("Hello world");
    fileLines.add("This is a test.");
    fileLines.add("World of Java!");

    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

    assertEquals("Total words should be 9", 9, result.getFirst());

    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();
    expectedCounts.put("hello", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("world", 2);
    expectedCounts.put("this", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("is", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("a", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("test", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("of", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("java", 1);

    assertEquals("Word counts should match expected counts", expectedCounts, result.getSecond());
}
```

### Mermaid Diagram for Unit Testing Architecture

Below is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the architecture of unit testing in CountYourWords. This diagram shows how JUnit tests are integrated into the development process.

```mermaid

### Conclusion

Unit testing is an essential part of the development process for CountYourWords. By using JUnit, we ensure that individual units of code work as expected. The goal is to achieve high test coverage to minimize bugs and improve software quality. The provided examples and mermaid diagram illustrate how unit tests are implemented and integrated into the development workflow.
