# Test Coverage Goals

## Test Coverage Goals

The CountYourWords project aims to achieve comprehensive test coverage to ensure its reliability and maintainability. The specific test coverage targets are outlined below:

### 1. Code Coverage Target
Our primary goal is to achieve a minimum code coverage of **90%** across all source files. This target ensures that the majority of the application's functionality is tested, reducing the likelihood of bugs and improving overall software quality.

#### Example:
```java
// CountYourWords.java
public class CountYourWords {
    public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) {
        // Implementation details...
    }
}
```

### 2. Unit Test Coverage Target
For each unit (method or function), we aim to achieve a minimum of **80%** coverage. This ensures that individual components are thoroughly tested and behave as expected.

#### Example:
```java
// CountYourWordsTest.java
public class CountYourWordsTest {
    @Test
    public void testEmptyFile() {
        ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
        Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);
        
        assertEquals("Total words should be 0", 0, result.getFirst());
        assertTrue("Word counts map should be empty", result.getSecond().isEmpty());
    }
}
```

### 3. Integration Test Coverage Target
Integration tests are crucial for ensuring that different components of the application work together seamlessly. We aim to achieve a minimum of **70%** coverage in integration tests.

#### Example:
```java
// SortTest.java
public class SortTest {
    @Test
    public void sortMultipleTest() {
        HashMap<String, Integer> multipleMap = new HashMap<>();
        multipleMap.put("cherry", 1);
        multipleMap.put("banana", 1);
        multipleMap.put("apple", 1);
        ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(multipleMap);
        
        List<String> expectedKeys = Arrays.asList("apple 1", "banana 1", "cherry 1");
        List<String> actualKeys = sortedArray;
        
        assertEquals("Keys should be sorted", expectedKeys, actualKeys);
    }
}
```

### 4. Test Coverage Metrics
To measure and track our progress towards these goals, we use several metrics:

- **Line Coverage:** The percentage of lines executed during tests.
- **Branch Coverage:** The percentage of branches (e.g., if statements) that are tested.
- **Method Coverage:** The percentage of methods that have at least one test case.

### 5. Test Coverage Tools
We utilize tools like JaCoCo and SonarQube to automatically measure and report on our test coverage. These tools help us identify untested code and ensure continuous improvement in our testing strategy.

#### Example JaCoCo Configuration:
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.jacoco</groupId>
    <artifactId>jacoco-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>0.8.7</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>prepare-agent</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>report</id>
            <phase>test</phase>
            <goals>
                <goal>report</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

### 6. Test Coverage Goals in Context
These coverage goals are integral to the overall testing strategy of CountYourWords. By ensuring high test coverage, we can:

- **Reduce Bug Introductions:** Catch and fix bugs early in the development cycle.
- **Improve Code Quality:** Ensure that each part of the application is thoroughly tested and reliable.
- **Facilitate Maintenance:** Make it easier to maintain and update the codebase by providing a safety net for changes.

### 7. Conclusion
Achieving these test coverage goals is critical for the success of CountYourWords. By adhering to these targets, we can build a robust and reliable application that meets user needs and provides a positive user experience.
