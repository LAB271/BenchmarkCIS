# Project Purpose

## Project Purpose

The primary goal of CountYourWords is to develop a robust text parser that processes an input file named `input.txt` to count words and their occurrences. The application must adhere to specific constraints, including ignoring numbers, special characters, and case sensitivity. Additionally, the output should be presented in alphabetical order, and the code must be production-ready with comprehensive testing and TDD practices.

### Intended Use Cases

1. **Text Analysis:** Counting word frequencies in large text documents for analysis.
2. **Content Management Systems (CMS):** Enhancing CMS functionalities to provide insights into content distribution.
3. **Search Engine Optimization (SEO):** Analyzing keyword density in web pages.
4. **Data Entry Automation:** Automating the process of counting words in data entry tasks.

### Target Audience

The target audience for CountYourWords includes:
- **Software Developers:** Individuals or teams working on text processing applications.
- **Educators and Students:** Those learning about Java programming, object-oriented design, and testing-driven development (TDD).
- **Technical Writers:** Professionals needing to analyze and report on document content.

### Key Features

1. **Word Counting:** The application processes the input file to count each word's occurrences.
2. **Case Insensitivity:** Word counting is case-insensitive, treating "Matchbox," "matchbox," and "MATCHBOX" as the same word.
3. **Ignoring Numbers and Special Characters:** Non-alphabetic characters are filtered out during processing.
4. **Alphabetical Output:** Results are presented in alphabetical order of words.
5. **Production-Ready Code:** The application is designed following SOLID principles and TDD practices to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Example Usage

The CountYourWords application reads from `input.txt`, processes the text according to the specified rules, and outputs the word count and occurrences. Here is a simplified example of how the application might be structured:

```java
// src/main/CountYourWords.java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class CountYourWords {
    public static Pair count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>();
        for (String line : fileLines) {
            String[] words = line.split("\\W+");
            for (String word : words) {
                if (!word.isEmpty()) {
                    wordCounts.put(word.toLowerCase(), wordCounts.getOrDefault(word.toLowerCase(), 0) + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        return new Pair(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
        fileLines.add("Hello world");
        fileLines.add("This is a test.");
        fileLines.add("World of Java!");

        Pair result = count(fileLines);

        System.out.println("Total words: " + result.getFirst());
        for (String entry : result.getSecond().keySet()) {
            System.out.println(entry);
        }
    }
}
```

### Dependencies

The CountYourWords project depends on the following libraries:
- `hamcrest-core-1.3.jar`: For assertions in testing.
- `junit-4.13.2.jar`: For unit testing.

These dependencies are managed via Maven and included in the project's classpath.

### Conclusion

CountYourWords is a comprehensive text parser designed to meet specific requirements for word counting, case insensitivity, and production-ready code. The application is structured to be easily testable and maintainable, making it suitable for various technical use cases and audiences.
