# Sorting Mechanisms

### Sorting Mechanisms

The `CountYourWords` project utilizes a sorting mechanism to organize word count results before presentation. This ensures that the output is not only accurate but also easy to interpret, with words presented in ascending order based on their frequency.

#### Overview of the Sorting Algorithm

The primary sorting algorithm used in `CountYourWords` is an insertion sort. This method is chosen for its simplicity and efficiency for smaller datasets, which is typical for word count results. The insertion sort algorithm works by iterating through the list, comparing each element with the ones before it, and inserting it into the correct position.

#### Implementation Details

The sorting logic is encapsulated in the `CountYourWords.sort` method, located in the `CountYourWords.java` file. Below is a detailed breakdown of this method:

```java
public static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {
    ArrayList<String> sortedWordCounts = new ArrayList<>();
    // Sort the words first
    ArrayList<String> sortedWords = Sort.insertionSort(wordCounts.keySet().toArray(new String[0]));

    // Now to add the values back
    for (String word : sortedWords) {
        String value = Integer.toString(wordCounts.get(word));
        String fString = word + " " + value;
        sortedWordCounts.add(fString);
    }

    return sortedWordCounts;
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **Input:** The method takes a `HashMap<String, Integer>` where keys are words and values are their counts.
- **Output:** It returns an `ArrayList<String>` containing strings of sorted words with their counts.
- **Sorting Logic:** Words are first extracted from the HashMap and sorted using the `Sort.insertionSort` method. Each word is then combined with its count to form a string, which is added to the result list.

#### Testing the Sorting Mechanism

To ensure the sorting mechanism works as expected, comprehensive tests are provided in the `CountYourWordsTest.java` file. Below are some key test cases:

```java
@Test
public void sortSingleTest() {
    HashMap<String, Integer> singleMap = new HashMap<>();
    singleMap.put("apple", 1);
    ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(singleMap);
    ArrayList<String> returnString = new ArrayList<>();
    returnString.add("apple 1");
    assertEquals(returnString, sortedArray);
}

@Test
public void sortMultipleTest() {
    HashMap<String, Integer> multipleMap = new HashMap<>();
    multipleMap.put("cherry", 1);
    multipleMap.put("banana", 1);
    multipleMap.put("apple", 1);
    ArrayList<String> sortedArray = CountYourWords.sort(multipleMap);

    List<String> expectedKeys = Arrays.asList("apple 1", "banana 1", "cherry 1");
    List<String> actualKeys = sortedArray;

    assertEquals("Keys should be sorted", expectedKeys, actualKeys);
}
```

**Key Points:**
- **sortSingleTest:** Tests sorting with a single word.
- **sortMultipleTest:** Tests sorting with multiple words and verifies the order.

#### Complexity Analysis

The insertion sort algorithm used in `CountYourWords` has a time complexity of O(n^2) due to its nested loops. This is suitable for smaller datasets, which is typical for word count results. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the sorted words and their counts.

### Conclusion

The sorting mechanism in `CountYourWords` is designed to organize word count results efficiently using an insertion sort algorithm. This ensures that the output is presented in ascending order based on word frequency, making it easy to interpret and analyze. The provided tests cover various scenarios to ensure the correctness of the sorting logic.
