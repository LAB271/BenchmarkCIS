# Word Counting Algorithm

### Word Counting Algorithm

The `CountYourWords` project includes a robust word counting algorithm that processes input text to count occurrences of each word. This algorithm is crucial for various applications such as text analysis, SEO optimization, and natural language processing.

#### Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of breaking down the input text into individual words or tokens. The `CountYourWords` algorithm uses a simple yet effective tokenization method:

```java
public static ArrayList<String> tokenize(String text) {
    return new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(text.split("\\s+")));
}
```

This method splits the input text using whitespace as the delimiter and returns an `ArrayList` of tokens.

#### Case Sensitivity Handling

The algorithm handles case sensitivity by converting all words to lowercase before counting. This ensures that words like "Hello" and "hello" are counted as the same word:

```java
public static HashMap<String, Integer> countWords(ArrayList<String> tokens) {
    HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>();
    for (String token : tokens) {
        String lowerCaseToken = token.toLowerCase();
        wordCounts.put(lowerCaseToken, wordCounts.getOrDefault(lowerCaseToken, 0) + 1);
    }
    return wordCounts;
}
```

#### Punctuation Rules

The algorithm ignores punctuation when counting words. For example, "hello," and "hello" are considered the same word:

```java
public static ArrayList<String> cleanTokens(ArrayList<String> tokens) {
    ArrayList<String> cleanedTokens = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String token : tokens) {
        if (!token.matches("[^a-zA-Z0-9]+")) {
            cleanedTokens.add(token.toLowerCase());
        }
    }
    return cleanedTokens;
}
```

This method filters out any tokens that contain non-alphanumeric characters, ensuring that only words are counted.

#### Putting It All Together

The `CountYourWords` algorithm combines these steps to count the occurrences of each word in a given text:

```java
public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) {
    ArrayList<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>();
    for (String line : fileLines) {
        tokens.addAll(cleanTokens(tokenize(line)));
    }
    int totalWords = tokens.size();
    HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = countWords(tokens);
    return new Pair<>(totalWords, wordCounts);
}
```

This method processes each line of the input text, cleans and tokenizes it, counts the words, and returns a `Pair` containing the total number of words and a map of word frequencies.

#### Example Usage

To use the `CountYourWords` algorithm, you can call the `count` method with an `ArrayList` of file lines:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
    fileLines.add("Hello world");
    fileLines.add("This is a test.");
    fileLines.add("World of Java!");

    Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

    System.out.println("Total words: " + result.getFirst());
    System.out.println("Word counts: " + result.getSecond());
}
```

This example demonstrates how to count the occurrences of each word in a list of file lines and print the results.

#### Conclusion

The `CountYourWords` project's word counting algorithm is designed to be efficient, accurate, and easy to understand. By handling tokenization, case sensitivity, and punctuation rules, this algorithm provides valuable insights into text data, making it an essential component for various applications in natural language processing and text analysis.
