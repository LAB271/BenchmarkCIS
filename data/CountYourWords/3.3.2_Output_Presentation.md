# Output Presentation

### Output Presentation

The `CountYourWords` application presents word count results through a simple command-line interface. The output is displayed in a user-friendly format, showing both the total number of words and a sorted list of words along with their frequencies.

#### User Interface

The primary interface for presenting the output is the console. When the user runs the application and provides a valid file path, the program reads the file, counts the words, sorts them by frequency, and then prints the results to the console.

Here is an example of how the output might look:

```plaintext
Enter the Path : /path/to/file.txt
Number of words: 20
big: 2
brown: 2
fox: 2
number: 1
4: 1
jumped: 2
over: 2
the: 2
lazy: 2
dog.: 1
```

#### Code Explanation

The output generation is handled by the `main` method in the `App.java` class. Below is a detailed breakdown of how the output is generated:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
    BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

    System.out.print("Enter the Path : ");

    // Reading File name
    String path = "";
    try {
        path = br.readLine();
    } catch (IOException e) {
        // TODO Auto-generated catch block
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    ArrayList<String> fileLines = CountYourWords.readFile(path);
    Pair wordTotalCount = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);
    ArrayList<String> finaList = CountYourWords.sort(wordTotalCount.getSecond());
    System.out.printf("Number of words: %d\n", wordTotalCount.getFirst());
    for (String line : finaList) {
        System.out.println(line);
    }
}
```

- **Reading the File Path:** The program prompts the user to enter a file path and reads it from the standard input.
- **File Reading:** The `readFile` method in the `CountYourWords.java` class is called to read the contents of the specified file into an `ArrayList<String>`.
- **Word Counting:** The `count` method processes the list of lines, counts the occurrences of each word, and returns a `Pair` object containing the total number of words and a map of word frequencies.
- **Sorting:** The `sort` method sorts the words by frequency in descending order.
- **Output:** The results are printed to the console. The total number of words is displayed first, followed by a sorted list of words with their respective counts.

#### Mermaid Diagram

Below is a mermaid diagram that illustrates the flow of data and control within the `main` method:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[User enters file path] --> B{Read file?};
    B -- Yes --> C[ReadFile(path)];
    C --> D[Count(fileLines)];
    D --> E[Sort(wordFrequencies)];
    E --> F[Print("Number of words: %d", totalCount)];
    F --> G[Print(sortedWordList)];
    B -- No --> H[Error handling];
```

This diagram shows the sequence of operations from user input to the final output, highlighting the key steps in the process.

#### Conclusion

The `CountYourWords` application presents word count results through a straightforward console interface. The output is generated by reading the file, counting words, sorting them, and then printing the results. This simple yet effective approach ensures that users can easily understand and utilize the tool for their word frequency analysis needs.
