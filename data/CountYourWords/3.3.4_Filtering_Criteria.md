# Filtering Criteria

### Filtering Criteria

The `CountYourWords` project includes several filtering rules applied to the word count data before it is presented to the user. These filters ensure that the output is accurate and meaningful, adhering to specific requirements and constraints.

#### Case Insensitivity

One of the primary filtering criteria is case insensitivity. The system ensures that words are counted without considering their case (e.g., "apple" and "Apple" are considered the same word). This is crucial for providing a more comprehensive word count analysis.

**Example Usage:**
```java
@Test
public void testCaseInsensitivity() {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
    fileLines.add("Apple apple APPLE ApPlE");

    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

    assertEquals(4, result.getFirst());

    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();
    expectedCounts.put("apple", 4);

    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());
}
```

**Explanation:**
In the example above, the `testCaseInsensitivity` method tests the case insensitivity of word counting. It adds a line with multiple occurrences of "apple" (in different cases) to an `ArrayList`. The `CountYourWords.count()` method is then called with this list, and it returns a `Pair` containing the total word count and the word counts map.

The test asserts that the total word count is 4 and that the word counts are case-insensitive. This ensures that all occurrences of "apple" are counted as one.

#### Empty File Handling

Another important filtering rule is handling empty files. If a file is empty, the system should return a total word count of 0 and an empty map for word counts.

**Example Usage:**
```java
@Test
public void testEmptyFile() {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();

    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

    assertEquals(0, result.getFirst());
    assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());
}
```

**Explanation:**
The `testEmptyFile` method tests the handling of empty files. It creates an empty `ArrayList` and calls the `CountYourWords.count()` method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 0 and that the word counts map is empty.

This ensures that the system correctly handles cases where no words are present in the file, providing a consistent and meaningful output.

#### Single Line Handling

The system also includes filtering rules for handling files with a single line. It should accurately count the words in the single line and return the correct word counts.

**Example Usage:**
```java
@Test
public void testSingleLine() {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
    fileLines.add("Hello world");

    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

    assertEquals(2, result.getFirst());

    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();
    expectedCounts.put("hello", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("world", 1);

    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());
}
```

**Explanation:**
The `testSingleLine` method tests the handling of files with a single line. It creates an `ArrayList` containing a single line and calls the `CountYourWords.count()` method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 2 and that the word counts match the expected values.

This ensures that the system correctly handles cases where words are present in a single line, providing accurate and meaningful output.

#### Multiple Lines Handling

Finally, the system includes filtering rules for handling files with multiple lines. It should accurately count the words across all lines and return the correct word counts.

**Example Usage:**
```java
@Test
public void testMultipleLines() {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
    fileLines.add("Hello world");
    fileLines.add("This is a test.");
    fileLines.add("World of Java!");

    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

    assertEquals(9, result.getFirst());

    HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();
    expectedCounts.put("hello", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("world", 2);
    expectedCounts.put("this", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("is", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("a", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("test", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("of", 1);
    expectedCounts.put("java", 1);

    assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());
}
```

**Explanation:**
The `testMultipleLines` method tests the handling of files with multiple lines. It creates an `ArrayList` containing multiple lines and calls the `CountYourWords.count()` method with this list. The test asserts that the total word count is 9 and that the word counts match the expected values.

This ensures that the system correctly handles cases where words are present across multiple lines, providing accurate and meaningful output.

### Summary

The filtering criteria in the `CountYourWords` project ensure that the word count data is processed accurately and meaningfully. The case insensitivity rule ensures that words are counted without considering their case, while the handling of empty files, single lines, and multiple lines ensures that the system correctly processes different types of input.

These filters contribute to a more comprehensive and reliable word count analysis, providing valuable insights into the content of text files.
