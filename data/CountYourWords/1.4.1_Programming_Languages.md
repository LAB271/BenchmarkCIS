# Programming Languages

## Programming Languages

CountYourWords is developed using Java, a robust and widely-used programming language known for its portability, performance, and extensive library support. Below are the details of the specific versions and features utilized in CountYourWords.

### Java Version
CountYourWords is built on Java version 11 (JDK 11). This version was chosen for its balance between performance, security, and feature set, making it suitable for both development and production environments.

```java
// Example of setting the Java version in a build tool like Maven
<properties>
    <maven.compiler.source>11</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>11</maven.compiler.target>
</properties>
```

### Key Libraries and Dependencies

#### Hamcrest Core (Version 1.3)
Hamcrest is used for writing readable assertions in tests. It provides a more expressive way to write test cases compared to traditional JUnit assertions.

```java
// Example of using Hamcrest in a test case
import static org.hamcrest.MatcherAssert.assertThat;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo;

@Test
public void testSingleLine() {
    ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
    fileLines.add("Hello world");

    Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

    assertThat(result.getFirst(), equalTo(2));
}
```

#### JUnit 4 (Version 4.13.2)
JUnit is the de-facto standard for writing repeatable tests in Java. It provides a simple and flexible framework to create and run tests.

```java
// Example of a JUnit test class
import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class CountYourWordsTest {
    @Test
    public void testEmptyFile() {
        ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
        Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);

        assertEquals(0, result.getFirst());
        assertTrue(result.getSecond().isEmpty());
    }
}
```

### Programming Language Features Utilized

#### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
CountYourWords is designed using OOP principles. It includes classes such as `CountYourWords`, `Sort`, and `Pair` to encapsulate functionality and promote code reusability.

```java
// Example of a simple class in CountYourWords
public class CountYourWords {
    public static Pair count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) {
        // Implementation details
    }

    public static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {
        // Implementation details
    }
}
```

#### Generics
Generics are used extensively to ensure type safety and reduce the need for casting.

```java
// Example of using generics in CountYourWords
public class Pair<T, R> {
    private T first;
    private R second;

    public Pair(T first, R second) {
        this.first = first;
        this.second = second;
    }

    // Getters and setters
}
```

#### Lambda Expressions and Streams
Lambda expressions and streams are used to simplify data processing and manipulation.

```java
// Example of using lambda expressions and streams in CountYourWords
public static ArrayList<String> sort(HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts) {
    return wordCounts.entrySet().stream()
        .sorted(Map.Entry.comparingByValue(Comparator.reverseOrder()))
        .map(entry -> entry.getKey() + " " + entry.getValue())
        .collect(Collectors.toCollection(ArrayList::new));
}
```

### Conclusion
CountYourWords is a well-structured Java application that leverages modern language features and popular libraries to ensure robustness, readability, and maintainability. The use of Java 11, Hamcrest, and JUnit contributes to the project's reliability and ease of testing.
