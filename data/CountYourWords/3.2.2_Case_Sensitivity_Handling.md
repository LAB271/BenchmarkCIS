# Case Sensitivity Handling

### Case Sensitivity Handling

The `CountYourWords` algorithm handles case sensitivity by treating words in a case-insensitive manner. This means that words like "word" and "Word" are counted as the same word, resulting in a total count of 1 for both occurrences.

#### Implementation Details

To achieve this, the algorithm uses a `HashMap<String, Integer>` to store word counts. When processing each line of text, it splits the line into individual words using whitespace as the delimiter. Each word is then converted to lowercase before being added to the map. This ensures that all variations of the same word (e.g., "apple", "Apple", "APPLE") are counted together.

Here is a simplified example of how this might be implemented in Java:

```java
public class CountYourWords {
    public static Pair<Integer, HashMap<String, Integer>> count(ArrayList<String> fileLines) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> wordCounts = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String line : fileLines) {
            String[] words = line.split("\\s+");
            for (String word : words) {
                // Convert word to lowercase to ensure case-insensitivity
                String lowerCaseWord = word.toLowerCase();
                wordCounts.put(lowerCaseWord, wordCounts.getOrDefault(lowerCaseWord, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return new Pair<>(wordCounts.size(), wordCounts);
    }
}
```

#### Testing Case Sensitivity

To verify that the case-insensitivity handling works as expected, a test method named `testCaseInsensitivity` is provided in the `CountYourWordsTest` class. This test adds a line with multiple occurrences of "apple" (in different cases) to an `ArrayList`. It then calls the `count()` method and asserts that the total word count is 4 and that the word counts are case-insensitive.

```java
public class CountYourWordsTest {
    @Test
    public void testCaseInsensitivity() {
        ArrayList<String> fileLines = new ArrayList<>();
        fileLines.add("Apple apple APPLE ApPlE");
        
        Pair result = CountYourWords.count(fileLines);
        
        assertEquals(4, result.getFirst());
        
        HashMap<String, Integer> expectedCounts = new HashMap<>();
        expectedCounts.put("apple", 4);
        
        assertEquals(expectedCounts, result.getSecond());
    }
}
```

#### Mermaid Diagram

To better visualize the flow of data through the `count()` method, a simple Mermaid diagram can be used:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Input: ArrayList<String> fileLines] --> B{Split line into words};
    B -- Word is "apple" --> C{Convert to lowercase};
    C -- Lowercase word is "apple" --> D[Update word count in HashMap];
    D --> E[Repeat for all words and lines];
    E --> F[Return Pair with total word count and word counts map];
```

This diagram shows the key steps involved in counting words, including splitting lines into words, converting them to lowercase, updating the word count map, and returning the results.

#### Conclusion

The `CountYourWords` algorithm handles case sensitivity by treating all variations of a word as the same. This is achieved through the use of a `HashMap<String, Integer>` where each word is converted to lowercase before being added or updated in the map. The provided test method ensures that this functionality works correctly, and a Mermaid diagram helps visualize the flow of data through the algorithm.
