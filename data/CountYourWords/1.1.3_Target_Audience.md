    int totalWords = 0;

    for (String line : fileLines) {
        String[] words = line.split("\\s+");
        totalWords += words.length;
        for (String word : words) {
            word = word.toLowerCase().replaceAll("[^a-z]", "");
            if (!word.isEmpty()) {
                wordCounts.put(word, wordCounts.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
    }

    return new Pair(totalWords, wordCounts);
}
```

    System.out.println("Total words: " + result.getFirst());
    for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : result.getSecond().entrySet()) {
        System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
    }
}
```
